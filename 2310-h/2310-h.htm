    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sun was going down on the Carquinez Woods. The few shafts of sunlight
      that had pierced their pillared gloom were lost in unfathomable depths, or
      splintered their ineffectual lances on the enormous trunks of the
      redwoods. For a time the dull red of their vast columns, and the dull red
      of their cast-off bark which matted the echoless aisles, still seemed to
      hold a faint glow of the dying day. But even this soon passed. Light and
      color fled upwards. The dark interlaced treetops, that had all day made an
      impenetrable shade, broke into fire here and there; their lost spires
      glittered, faded, and went utterly out. A weird twilight that did not come
      from the outer world, but seemed born of the wood itself, slowly filled
      and possessed the aisles. The straight, tall, colossal trunks rose dimly
      like columns of upward smoke. The few fallen trees stretched their huge
      length into obscurity, and seemed to lie on shadowy trestles. The strange
      breath that filled these mysterious vaults had neither coldness nor
      moisture; a dry, fragrant dust arose from the noiseless foot that trod
      their bark-strewn floor; the aisles might have been tombs, the fallen
      trees enormous mummies; the silence the solitude of a forgotten past.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet this silence was presently broken by a recurring sound like
      breathing, interrupted occasionally by inarticulate and stertorous gasps.
      It was not the quick, panting, listening breath of some stealthy feline or
      canine animal, but indicated a larger, slower, and more powerful
      organization, whose progress was less watchful and guarded, or as if a
      fragment of one of the fallen monsters had become animate. At times this
      life seemed to take visible form, but as vaguely, as misshapenly, as the
      phantom of a nightmare. Now it was a square object moving sideways,
      endways, with neither head nor tail and scarcely visible feet; then an
      arched bulk rolling against the trunks of the trees and recoiling again,
      or an upright cylindrical mass, but always oscillating and unsteady, and
      striking the trees on either hand. The frequent occurrence of the movement
      suggested the figures of some weird rhythmic dance to music heard by the
      shape alone. Suddenly it either became motionless or faded away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the frightened neighing of a horse, the sudden jingling of
      spurs, a shout and outcry, and the swift apparition of three dancing
      torches in one of the dark aisles; but so intense was the obscurity that
      they shed no light on surrounding objects, and seemed to advance of their
      own volition without human guidance, until they disappeared suddenly
      behind the interposing bulk of one of the largest trees. Beyond its eighty
      feet of circumference the light could not reach, and the gloom remained
      inscrutable. But the voices and jingling spurs were heard distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast the mare! She's shied off that cursed trail again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye ain't lost it again, hev ye?&rdquo; growled a second voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's jist what I hev. And these blasted pine-knots don't give light an
      inch beyond 'em. D&mdash;d if I don't think they make this cursed hole
      blacker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a laugh&mdash;a woman's laugh&mdash;hysterical, bitter,
      sarcastic, exasperating. The second speaker, without heeding it, went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in thunder skeert the hosses? Did you see or hear anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'. The wood is like a graveyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman's voice again broke into a hoarse, contemptuous laugh. The man
      resumed angrily:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know anything, why in h-ll don't you say so, instead of cackling
      like a d&mdash;d squaw there? P'raps you reckon you ken find the trail
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this rope off my wrist,&rdquo; said the woman's voice, &ldquo;untie my hands,
      let me down, and I'll find it.&rdquo; She spoke quickly and with a Spanish
      accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the men's turn to laugh. &ldquo;And give you a show to snatch that
      six-shooter and blow a hole through me, as you did to the Sheriff of
      Calaveras, eh? Not if this court understands itself,&rdquo; said the first
      speaker dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the devil, then,&rdquo; she said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not before a lady,&rdquo; responded the other. There was another laugh from the
      men, the spurs jingled again, the three torches reappeared from behind the
      tree, and then passed away in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time silence and immutability possessed the woods; the great trunks
      loomed upwards, their fallen brothers stretched their slow length into
      obscurity. The sound of breathing again became audible; the shape
      reappeared in the aisle, and recommenced its mystic dance. Presently it
      was lost in the shadow of the largest tree, and to the sound of breathing
      succeeded a grating and scratching of bark. Suddenly, as if riven by
      lightning, a flash broke from the center of the tree-trunk, lit up the
      woods, and a sharp report rang through it. After a pause the jingling of
      spurs and the dancing of torches were revived from the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who fired that shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was no reply. A slight veil of smoke passed away to the right,
      there was the spice of gunpowder in the air, but nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The torches came forward again, but this time it could be seen they were
      held in the hands of two men and a woman. The woman's hands were tied at
      the wrist to the horse-hair reins of her mule, while a riata, passed
      around her waist and under the mule's girth, was held by one of the men,
      who were both armed with rifles and revolvers. Their frightened horses
      curveted, and it was with difficulty they could be made to advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! stranger, what are you shooting at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman laughed and shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Look yonder at the roots of
      the tree. You're a d&mdash;d smart man for a sheriff, ain't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man uttered an exclamation and spurred his horse forward, but the
      animal reared in terror. He then sprang to the ground and approached the
      tree. The shape lay there, a scarcely distinguishable bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A grizzly, by the living Jingo! Shot through the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. The strange shape lit up by the flaring torches seemed more
      vague, unearthly, and awkward in its dying throes, yet the small shut
      eyes, the feeble nose, the ponderous shoulders, and half-human foot armed
      with powerful claws were unmistakable. The men turned by a common impulse
      and peered into the remote recesses of the wood again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, Mister! come and pick up your game. Hallo there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The challenge fell unheeded on the empty woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said he whom the woman had called the sheriff, &ldquo;he can't be far
      off. It was a close shot, and the bear hez dropped in his tracks. Why,
      wot's this sticking in his claws?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men bent over the animal. &ldquo;Why, it's sugar, brown sugar&mdash;look!&rdquo;
       There was no mistake. The huge beast's fore paws and muzzle were streaked
      with the unromantic household provision, and heightened the absurd
      contrast of its incongruous members. The woman, apparently indifferent,
      had taken that opportunity to partly free one of her wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we hadn't been cavorting round this yer spot for the last half hour,
      I'd swear there was a shanty not a hundred yards away,&rdquo; said the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man, without replying, remounted his horse instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is, and it's inhabited by a gentleman that kin make centre shots
      like that in the dark, and don't care to explain how, I reckon I won't
      disturb him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff was apparently of the same opinion, for he followed his
      companion's example, and once more led the way. The spurs tinkled, the
      torches danced, and the cavalcade slowly reentered the gloom. In another
      moment it had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wood sank again into repose, this time disturbed by neither shape nor
      sound. What lower forms of life might have crept close to its roots were
      hidden in the ferns, or passed with deadened tread over the bark-strewn
      floor. Towards morning a coolness like dew fell from above, with here and
      there a dropping twig or nut, or the crepitant awakening and
      stretching-out of cramped and weary branches. Later a dull, lurid dawn,
      not unlike the last evening's sunset, filled the aisles. This faded again,
      and a clear gray light, in which every object stood out in sharp
      distinctness, took its place. Morning was waiting outside in all its
      brilliant, youthful coloring, but only entered as the matured and sobered
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seen in that stronger light, the monstrous tree near which the dead bear
      lay revealed its age in its denuded and scarred trunk, and showed in its
      base a deep cavity, a foot or two from the ground, partly hidden by
      hanging strips of bark which had fallen across it. Suddenly one of these
      strips was pushed aside, and a young man leaped lightly down.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the rifle he carried and some modern peculiarities of dress, he
      was of a grace so unusual and unconventional that he might have passed for
      a faun who was quitting his ancestral home. He stepped to the side of the
      bear with a light elastic movement that was as unlike customary
      progression as his face and figure were unlike the ordinary types of
      humanity. Even as he leaned upon his rifle, looking down at the prostrate
      animal, he unconsciously fell into an attitude that in any other mortal
      would have been a pose, but with him was the picturesque and unstudied
      relaxation of perfect symmetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Mister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head so carelessly and listlessly that he did not otherwise
      change his attitude. Stepping from behind the tree, the woman of the
      preceding night stood before him. Her hands were free except for a thong
      of the riata, which was still knotted around one wrist, the end of the
      thong having been torn or burnt away. Her eyes were bloodshot, and her
      hair hung over her shoulders in one long black braid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckoned all along it was YOU who shot the bear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;at least
      some one hiding yer,&rdquo; and she indicated the hollow tree with her hand. &ldquo;It
      wasn't no chance shot.&rdquo; Observing that the young man, either from
      misconception or indifference, did not seem to comprehend her, she added,
      &ldquo;We came by here, last night, a minute after you fired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was YOU kicked up such a row, was it?&rdquo; said the young man, with
      a shade of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; said the woman, nodding her head, &ldquo;and them that was with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheriff Dunn, of Yolo, and his deputy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are they now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deputy&mdash;in h-ll, I reckon; I don't know about the sheriff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the young man quietly; &ldquo;and you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;got away,&rdquo; she said savagely. But she was taken with a sudden
      nervous shiver, which she at once repressed by tightly dragging her shawl
      over her shoulders and elbows, and folding her arms defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To follow the deputy, may be,&rdquo; she said gloomily. &ldquo;But come, I say, ain't
      you going to treat? It's cursed cold here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment.&rdquo; The young man was looking at her, with his arched brows
      slightly knit and a half smile of curiosity. &ldquo;Ain't you Teresa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was prepared for the question, but evidently was not certain whether
      she would reply defiantly or confidently. After an exhaustive scrutiny of
      his face she chose the latter, and said, &ldquo;You can bet your life on it,
      Johnny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't bet, and my name isn't Johnny. Then you're the woman who stabbed
      Dick Curson over at Lagrange's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She became defiant again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's me, all the time. What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. And you used to dance at the Alhambra?&rdquo; She whisked the shawl
      from her shoulders, held it up like a scarf, and made one or two steps of
      the sembicuacua. There was not the least gayety, recklessness, or
      spontaneity in the action; it was simply mechanical bravado. It was so
      ineffective, even upon her own feelings, that her arms presently dropped
      to her side, and she coughed embarrassedly. &ldquo;Where's that whiskey,
      pardner?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man turned toward the tree he had just quitted, and without
      further words assisted her to mount to the cavity. It was an
      irregular-shaped vaulted chamber, pierced fifty feet above by a shaft or
      cylindrical opening in the decayed trunk, which was blackened by smoke, as
      if it had served the purpose of a chimney. In one corner lay a bearskin
      and blanket; at the side were two alcoves or indentations, one of which
      was evidently used as a table, and the other as a cupboard. In another
      hollow, near the entrance, lay a few small sacks of flour, coffee, and
      sugar, the sticky contents of the latter still strewing the floor. From
      this storehouse the young man drew a wicker flask of whiskey, and handed
      it, with a tin cup of water, to the woman. She waved the cup aside, placed
      the flask to her lips, and drank the undiluted spirit. Yet even this was
      evidently bravado, for the water started to her eyes, and she could not
      restrain the paroxysm of coughing that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that's the kind that kills at forty rods,&rdquo; she said, with a
      hysterical laugh. &ldquo;But I say, pardner, you look as if you were fixed here
      to stay,&rdquo; and she stared ostentatiously around the chamber. But she had
      already taken in its minutest details, even to observing that the hanging
      strips of bark could be disposed so as to completely hide the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;it wouldn't be very easy to pull up the stakes
      and move the shanty further on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that either from indifference or caution he had not accepted her
      meaning, she looked at him fixedly, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your little game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you hiding for&mdash;here, in this tree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm not hiding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why didn't you come out when they hailed you last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I didn't care to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa whistled incredulously. &ldquo;All right&mdash;then if you're not hiding,
      I'm going to.&rdquo; As he did not reply, she went on: &ldquo;If I can keep out of
      sight for a couple of weeks, this thing will blow over here, and I can get
      across into Yolo. I could get a fair show there, where the boys know me.
      Just now the trails are all watched, but no one would think of lookin'
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how did you come to think of it?&rdquo; he asked carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I knew that bear hadn't gone far for that sugar; because I know
      he hadn't stole it from a cache&mdash;it was too fresh, and we'd have seen
      the torn-up earth; because we had passed no camp; and because I knew there
      was no shanty here. And, besides,&rdquo; she added in a low voice, &ldquo;maybe I was
      huntin' a hole myself to die in&mdash;and spotted it by instinct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in this suggestion of a hunted animal that, unlike
      anything she had previously said or suggested, was not exaggerated, and
      caused the young man to look at her again. She was standing under the
      chimney-like opening, and the light from above illuminated her head and
      shoulders. The pupils of her eyes had lost their feverish prominence, and
      were slightly suffused and softened as she gazed abstractedly before her.
      The only vestige of her previous excitement was in her left-hand fingers,
      which were incessantly twisting and turning a diamond ring upon her right
      hand, but without imparting the least animation to her rigid attitude.
      Suddenly, as if conscious of his scrutiny, she stepped aside out of the
      revealing light and by a swift feminine instinct raised her hand to her
      head as if to adjust her straggling hair. It was only for a moment,
      however, for, as if aware of the weakness, she struggled to resume her
      aggressive pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Speak up. Am I goin' to stop here, or have I got to get
      up and get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can stay,&rdquo; said the young man quietly; &ldquo;but as I've got my provisions
      and ammunition here, and haven't any other place to go to just now, I
      suppose we'll have to share it together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him under her eyelids, and a half-bitter, half-contemptuous
      smile passed across her face. &ldquo;All right, old man,&rdquo; she said, holding out
      her hand, &ldquo;it's a go. We'll start in housekeeping at once, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to come here once or twice a day,&rdquo; he said, quite composedly,
      &ldquo;to look after my things, and get something to eat; but I'll be away most
      of the time, and what with camping out under the trees every night I
      reckon my share won't incommode you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her black eyes upon him, at this original proposition. Then she
      looked down at her torn dress. &ldquo;I suppose this style of thing ain't very
      fancy, is it?&rdquo; she said, with a forced laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know where to beg or borrow a change for you, if you can't get
      any,&rdquo; he replied simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him again. &ldquo;Are you a family man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you can tell your girl I'm
      not particular about its being in the latest fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight flush on his forehead as he turned toward the little
      cupboard, but no tremor in his voice as he went on: &ldquo;You'll find tea and
      coffee here, and, if you're bored, there's a book or two. You read, don't
      you&mdash;I mean English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, but cast a look of undisguised contempt upon the two worn,
      coverless novels he held out to her. &ldquo;You haven't got last week's
      'Sacramento Union,' have you? I hear they have my case all in; only them
      lying reporters made it out against me all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see the papers,&rdquo; he replied curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say there's a picture of me in the 'Police Gazette,' taken in the
      act,&rdquo; and she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked a little abstracted, and turned as if to go. &ldquo;I think you'll do
      well to rest a while just now, and keep as close hid as possible until
      afternoon. The trail is a mile away at the nearest point, but some one
      might miss it and stray over here. You're quite safe if you're careful,
      and stand by the tree. You can build a fire here,&rdquo; he stepped under the
      chimney-like opening, &ldquo;without its being noticed. Even the smoke is lost
      and cannot be seen so high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light from above was falling on his head and shoulders, as it had on
      hers. She looked at him intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You travel a good deal on your figure, pardner, don't you?&rdquo; she said,
      with a certain admiration that was quite sexless in its quality; &ldquo;but I
      don't see how you pick up a living by it in the Carquinez Woods. So you're
      going, are you? You might be more sociable. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; He leaped from the opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say pardner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned a little impatiently. She had knelt down at the entrance, so as
      to be nearer his level, and was holding out her hand. But he did not
      notice it, and she quietly withdrew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anybody dropped in and asked for you, what name will they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;Don't wait to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose I wanted to sing out for you, what will I call you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. &ldquo;Call me&mdash;Lo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lo, the poor Indian?&rdquo; *
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The first word of Pope's familiar apostrophe is humorously
     used in the Far West as a distinguishing title for the
     Indian.
</pre>
    <p>
      It suddenly occurred to the woman, Teresa, that in the young man's height,
      supple, yet erect carriage, color, and singular gravity of demeanor there
      was a refined, aboriginal suggestion. He did not look like any Indian she
      had ever seen, but rather as a youthful chief might have looked. There was
      a further suggestion in his fringed buckskin shirt and moccasins; but
      before she could utter the half-sarcastic comment that rose to her lips he
      had glided noiselessly away, even as an Indian might have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      She readjusted the slips of hanging bark with feminine ingenuity,
      dispersing them so as to completely hide the entrance. Yet this did not
      darken the chamber, which seemed to draw a purer and more vigorous light
      through the soaring shaft that pierced the roof than that which came from
      the dim woodland aisles below. Nevertheless, she shivered, and drawing her
      shawl closely around her began to collect some half-burnt fragments of
      wood in the chimney to make a fire. But the preoccupation of her thoughts
      rendered this a tedious process, as she would from time to time stop in
      the middle of an action and fall into an attitude of rapt abstraction,
      with far-off eyes and rigid mouth. When she had at last succeeded in
      kindling a fire and raising a film of pale blue smoke, that seemed to fade
      and dissipate entirely before it reached the top of the chimney shaft, she
      crouched beside it, fixed her eyes on the darkest corner of the cavern,
      and became motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did she see through that shadow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing at first but a confused medley of figures and incidents of the
      preceding night; things to be put away and forgotten; things that would
      not have happened but for another thing&mdash;the thing before which
      everything faded! A ball-room; the sounds of music; the one man she had
      cared for insulting her with the flaunting ostentation of his
      unfaithfulness; herself despised, put aside, laughed at, or worse, jilted.
      And then the moment of delirium, when the light danced; the one wild act
      that lifted her, the despised one, above them all&mdash;made her the
      supreme figure, to be glanced at by frightened women, stared at by
      half-startled, half-admiring men! &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she laughed; but struck by the
      sound of her own voice, moved twice round the cavern nervously, and then
      dropped again into her old position.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they carried him away he had laughed at her&mdash;like a hound that he
      was; he who had praised her for her spirit, and incited her revenge
      against others; he who had taught her to strike when she was insulted; and
      it was only fit he should reap what he had sown. She was what he, what
      other men, had made her. And what was she now? What had she been once?
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to recall her childhood: the man and woman who might have been
      her father and mother; who fought and wrangled over her precocious little
      life; abused or caressed her as she sided with either; and then left her
      with a circus troupe, where she first tasted the power of her courage, her
      beauty, and her recklessness. She remembered those flashes of triumph that
      left a fever in her veins&mdash;a fever that when it failed must be
      stimulated by dissipation, by anything, by everything that would keep her
      name a wonder in men's mouths, an envious fear to women. She recalled her
      transfer to the strolling players; her cheap pleasures, and cheaper
      rivalries and hatred&mdash;but always Teresa! the daring Teresa! the
      reckless Teresa! audacious as a woman, invincible as a boy; dancing,
      flirting, fencing, shooting, swearing, drinking, smoking, fighting Teresa!
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; she had been loved, perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;but always
      feared. Why should she change now? Ha, he should see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had lashed herself in a frenzy, as was her wont, with gestures,
      ejaculations, oaths, adjurations, and passionate apostrophes, but with
      this strange and unexpected result. Heretofore she had always been
      sustained and kept up by an audience of some kind or quality, if only
      perhaps a humble companion; there had always been some one she could
      fascinate or horrify, and she could read her power mirrored in their eyes.
      Even the half-abstracted indifference of her strange host had been
      something. But she was alone now. Her words fell on apathetic solitude;
      she was acting to viewless space. She rushed to the opening, dashed the
      hanging bark aside, and leaped to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran forward wildly a few steps, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Look, 'tis I, Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The profound silence remained unbroken. Her shrillest tones were lost in
      an echoless space, even as the smoke of her fire had faded into pure
      ether. She stretched out her clenched fists as if to defy the pillared
      austerities of the vaults around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and take me if you dare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The challenge was unheeded. If she had thrown herself violently against
      the nearest tree-trunk, she could not have been stricken more breathless
      than she was by the compact, embattled solitude that encompassed her. The
      hopelessness of impressing these cold and passive vaults with her selfish
      passion filled her with a vague fear. In her rage of the previous night
      she had not seen the wood in its profound immobility. Left alone with the
      majesty of those enormous columns, she trembled and turned faint. The
      silence of the hollow tree she had just quitted seemed to her less awful
      than the crushing presence of these mute and monstrous witnesses of her
      weakness. Like a wounded quail with lowered crest and trailing wing, she
      crept back to her hiding place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then the influence of the wood was still upon her. She picked up the
      novel she had contemptuously thrown aside, only to let it fall again in
      utter weariness. For a moment her feminine curiosity was excited by the
      discovery of an old book, in whose blank leaves were pressed a variety of
      flowers and woodland grasses. As she could not conceive that these had
      been kept for any but a sentimental purpose, she was disappointed to find
      that underneath each was a sentence in an unknown tongue, that even to her
      untutored eye did not appear to be the language of passion. Finally she
      rearranged the couch of skins and blankets, and, imparting to it in three
      clever shakes an entirely different character, lay down to pursue her
      reveries. But nature asserted herself, and ere she knew it she was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      So intense and prolonged had been her previous excitement that, the
      tension once relieved, she passed into a slumber of exhaustion so deep
      that she seemed scarce to breathe. High noon succeeded morning, the
      central shaft received a single ray of upper sunlight, the afternoon came
      and went, the shadows gathered below, the sunset fires began to eat their
      way through the groined roof, and she still slept. She slept even when the
      bark hangings of the chamber were put aside, and the young man reentered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid down a bundle he was carrying and softly approached the sleeper.
      For a moment he was startled from his indifference; she lay so still and
      motionless. But this was not all that struck him; the face before him was
      no longer the passionate, haggard visage that confronted him that morning;
      the feverish air, the burning color, the strained muscles of mouth and
      brow, and the staring eyes were gone; wiped away, perhaps, by the tears
      that still left their traces on cheek and dark eyelash. It was the face of
      a handsome woman of thirty, with even a suggestion of softness in the
      contour of the cheek and arching of her upper lip, no longer rigidly drawn
      down in anger, but relaxed by sleep on her white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the lithe, soft tread that was habitual to him, the young man moved
      about, examining the condition of the little chamber and its stock of
      provisions and necessaries, and withdrew presently, to reappear as
      noiselessly with a tin bucket of water. This done, he replenished the
      little pile of fuel with an armful of bark and pine cones, cast an
      approving glance about him, which included the sleeper, and silently
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was night when she awoke. She was surrounded by a profound darkness,
      except where the shaft-like opening made a nebulous mist in the corner of
      her wooden cavern. Providentially she struggled back to consciousness
      slowly, so that the solitude and silence came upon her gradually, with a
      growing realization of the events of the past twenty-four hours, but
      without a shock. She was alone here, but safe still, and every hour added
      to her chances of ultimate escape. She remembered to have seen a candle
      among the articles on the shelf, and she began to grope her way towards
      the matches. Suddenly she stopped. What was that panting?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it her own breathing, quickened with a sudden nameless terror? or was
      there something outside? Her heart seemed to stop beating while she
      listened. Yes! it was a panting outside&mdash;a panting now increased,
      multiplied, redoubled, mixed with the sounds of rustling, tearing,
      craunching, and occasionally a quick, impatient snarl. She crept on her
      hands and knees to the opening and looked out. At first the ground seemed
      to be undulating between her and the opposite tree. But a second glance
      showed her the black and gray, bristling, tossing backs of tumbling beasts
      of prey, charging the carcass of the bear that lay at its roots, or
      contesting for the prize with gluttonous, choked breath, sidelong snarls,
      arched spines, and recurved tails. One of the boldest had leaped upon a
      buttressing root of her tree within a foot of the opening. The excitement,
      awe, and terror she had undergone culminated in one wild, maddened scream,
      that seemed to pierce even the cold depths of the forest, as she dropped
      on her face, with her hands clasped over her eyes in an agony of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her scream was answered, after a pause, by a sudden volley of firebrands
      and sparks into the midst of the panting, crowding pack; a few smothered
      howls and snaps, and a sudden dispersion of the concourse. In another
      moment the young man, with a blazing brand in either hand, leaped upon the
      body of the bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa raised her head, uttered a hysterical cry, slid down the tree, flew
      wildly to his side, caught convulsively at his sleeve, and fell on her
      knees beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me! save me!&rdquo; she gasped, in a voice broken by terror. &ldquo;Save me from
      those hideous creatures. No, no!&rdquo; she implored, as he endeavored to lift
      her to her feet. &ldquo;No&mdash;let me stay here close beside you. So,&rdquo;
       clutching the fringe of his leather hunting-shirt, and dragging herself on
      her knees nearer him&mdash;&ldquo;so&mdash;don't leave me, for God's sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are gone,&rdquo; he replied, gazing down curiously at her, as she wound
      the fringe around her hand to strengthen her hold; &ldquo;they're only a lot of
      cowardly coyotes and wolves, that dare not attack anything that lives and
      can move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman responded with a nervous shudder. &ldquo;Yes, that's it,&rdquo; she
      whispered, in a broken voice; &ldquo;it's only the dead they want. Promise me&mdash;swear
      to me, if I'm caught, or hung, or shot, you won't let me be left here to
      be torn and&mdash;ah! my God! what's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had thrown her arms around his knees, completely pinioning him to her
      frantic breast. Something like a smile of disdain passed across his face
      as he answered, &ldquo;It's nothing. They will not return. Get up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even in her terror she saw the change in his face. &ldquo;I know, I know!&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;I'm frightened&mdash;but I cannot bear it any longer. Hear me!
      Listen! Listen&mdash;but don't move! I didn't mean to kill Curson&mdash;no!
      I swear to God, no! I didn't mean to kill the sheriff&mdash;and I didn't.
      I was only bragging&mdash;do you hear? I lied! I lied&mdash;don't move, I
      swear to God I lied. I've made myself out worse than I was. I have. Only
      don't leave me now&mdash;and if I die&mdash;and it's not far off, may be&mdash;get
      me away from here&mdash;and from THEM. Swear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the young man, with a scarcely concealed movement of
      irritation. &ldquo;But get up now, and go back to the cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not THERE alone.&rdquo; Nevertheless, he quietly but firmly released
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will stay here,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I would have been nearer to you, but I
      thought it better for your safety that my camp-fire should be further off.
      But I can build it here, and that will keep the coyotes off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me stay with you&mdash;beside you,&rdquo; she said imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked so broken, crushed, and spiritless, so unlike the woman of the
      morning that, albeit with an ill grace, he tacitly consented, and turned
      away to bring his blankets. But in the next moment she was at his side,
      following him like a dog, silent and wistful, and even offering to carry
      his burden. When he had built the fire, for which she had collected the
      pine-cones and broken branches near them, he sat down, folded his arms,
      and leaned back against the tree in reserved and deliberate silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humble and submissive, she did not attempt to break in upon a reverie she
      could not help but feel had little kindliness to herself. As the fire
      snapped and sparkled, she pillowed her head upon a root, and lay still to
      watch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It rose and fell, and dying away at times to a mere lurid glow, and again,
      agitated by some breath scarcely perceptible to them, quickening into a
      roaring flame. When only the embers remained, a dead silence filled the
      wood. Then the first breath of morning moved the tangled canopy above, and
      a dozen tiny sprays and needles detached from the interlocked boughs
      winged their soft way noiselessly to the earth. A few fell upon the
      prostrate woman like a gentle benediction, and she slept. But even then,
      the young man, looking down, saw that the slender fingers were still
      aimlessly but rigidly twisted in the leather fringe of his hunting-shirt.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a peculiarity of the Carquinez Wood that it stood apart and
      distinct in its gigantic individuality. Even where the integrity of its
      own singular species was not entirely preserved, it admitted no inferior
      trees. Nor was there any diminishing fringe on its outskirts; the
      sentinels that guarded the few gateways of the dim trails were as
      monstrous as the serried ranks drawn up in the heart of the forest.
      Consequently, the red highway that skirted the eastern angle was bare and
      shadeless, until it slipped a league off into a watered valley and
      refreshed itself under lesser sycamores and willows. It was here the newly
      born city of Excelsior, still in its cradle, had, like an infant Hercules,
      strangled the serpentine North Fork of the American river, and turned its
      life current into the ditches and flumes of the Excelsior mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newest of the new houses that seemed to have accidentally formed its
      single, straggling street was the residence of the Rev. Winslow Wynn, not
      unfrequently known as &ldquo;Father Wynn,&rdquo; pastor of the First Baptist church.
      The &ldquo;pastorage,&rdquo; as it was cheerfully called, had the glaring distinction
      of being built of brick, and was, as had been wickedly pointed out by idle
      scoffers, the only &ldquo;fireproof&rdquo; structure in town. This sarcasm was not,
      however, supposed to be particularly distasteful to &ldquo;Father Wynn,&rdquo; who
      enjoyed the reputation of being &ldquo;hail fellow, well met&rdquo; with the rough
      mining element, who called them by their Christian names, had been known
      to drink at the bar of the Polka Saloon while engaged in the conversion of
      a prominent citizen, and was popularly said to have no &ldquo;gospel starch&rdquo;
       about him. Certain conscious outcasts and transgressors were touched at
      this apparent unbending of the spiritual authority. The rigid tenets of
      Father Wynn's faith were lost in the supposed catholicity of his humanity.
      &ldquo;A preacher that can jine a man when he's histin' liquor into him, without
      jawin' about it, ought to be allowed to wrestle with sinners and splash
      about in as much cold water as he likes,&rdquo; was the criticism of one of his
      converts. Nevertheless, it was true that Father Wynn was somewhat loud and
      intolerant in his tolerance. It was true that he was a little more rough,
      a little more frank, a little more hearty, a little more impulsive than
      his disciples. It was true that often the proclamation of his extreme
      liberality and brotherly equality partook somewhat of an apology. It is
      true that a few who might have been most benefited by this kind of gospel
      regarded him with a singular disdain. It is true that his liberality was
      of an ornamental, insinuating quality, accompanied with but little
      sacrifice; his acceptance of a collection taken up in a gambling saloon
      for the rebuilding of his church, destroyed by fire, gave him a popularity
      large enough, it must be confessed, to cover the sins of the gamblers
      themselves, but it was not proven that HE had ever organized any form of
      relief. But it was true that local history somehow accepted him as an
      exponent of mining Christianity, without the least reference to the
      opinions of the Christian miners themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Mr. Wynn's liberal habits and opinions were not, however, shared
      by his only daughter, a motherless young lady of eighteen. Nellie Wynn was
      in the eye of Excelsior an unapproachable divinity, as inaccessible and
      cold as her father was impulsive and familiar. An atmosphere of chaste and
      proud virginity made itself felt even in the starched integrity of her
      spotless skirts, in her neatly gloved finger-tips, in her clear amber
      eyes, in her imperious red lips, in her sensitive nostrils. Need it be
      said that the youth and middle age of Excelsior were madly, because
      apparently hopelessly, in love with her? For the rest, she had been
      expensively educated, was profoundly ignorant in two languages, with a
      trained misunderstanding of music and painting, and a natural and
      faultless taste in dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Mr. Wynn was engaged in a characteristic hearty parting with one
      of his latest converts, upon his own doorstep, with admirable al fresco
      effect. He had just clapped him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Good-by, good-by,
      Charley, my boy, and keep in the right path; not up, or down, or round the
      gulch, you know&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;but straight across lots to the
      shining gate.&rdquo; He had raised his voice under the stimulus of a few
      admiring spectators, and backed his convert playfully against the wall.
      &ldquo;You see! we're goin' in to win, you bet. Good-by! I'd ask you to step in
      and have a chat, but I've got my work to do, and so have you. The gospel
      mustn't keep us from that, must it, Charley? Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The convert (who elsewhere was a profane expressman, and had become quite
      imbecile under Mr. Wynn's active heartiness and brotherly horse-play
      before spectators) managed, however, to feebly stammer with a blush
      something about &ldquo;Miss Nellie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Nellie. She, too, is at her tasks&mdash;trimming her lamp&mdash;you
      know, the parable of the wise virgins,&rdquo; continued Father Wynn hastily,
      fearing that the convert might take the illustration literally. &ldquo;There,
      there&mdash;good-by. Keep in the right path.&rdquo; And with a parting shove he
      dismissed Charley and entered his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;wise virgin,&rdquo; Nellie, had evidently finished with the lamp, and was
      now going out to meet the bridegroom, as she was fully dressed and gloved,
      and had a pink parasol in her hand, as her father entered the
      sitting-room. His bluff heartiness seemed to fade away as he removed his
      soft, broad-brimmed hat and glanced across the too fresh-looking
      apartment. There was a smell of mortar still in the air, and a faint
      suggestion that at any moment green grass might appear between the
      interstices of the red-brick hearth. The room, yielding a little in the
      point of coldness, seemed to share Miss Nellie's fresh virginity, and,
      barring the pink parasol, set her off as in a vestal's cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I supposed you wouldn't care to see Brace, the expressman, so I got rid
      of him at the door,&rdquo; said her father, drawing one of the new chairs
      towards him slowly, and sitting down carefully, as if it were a hitherto
      untried experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nellie's face took a tint of interest. &ldquo;Then he doesn't go with the
      coach to Indian Spring to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of going over myself to get the Burnham girls to come to
      choir-meeting,&rdquo; replied Miss Nellie carelessly, &ldquo;and he might have been
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd go now, if he knew you were going,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;but it's just
      as well he shouldn't be needlessly encouraged. I rather think that Sheriff
      Dunn is a little jealous of him. By the way, the sheriff is much better. I
      called to cheer him up to-day&rdquo; (Mr. Wynn had in fact tumultuously
      accelerated the sick man's pulse), &ldquo;and he talked of you, as usual. In
      fact, he said he had only two things to get well for. One was to catch and
      hang that woman Teresa, who shot him; the other&mdash;can't you guess the
      other?&rdquo; he added archly, with a faint suggestion of his other manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nellie coldly could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Mr. Wynn's archness vanished. &ldquo;Don't be a fool,&rdquo; he said dryly.
      &ldquo;He wants to marry you, and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of the men here do,&rdquo; responded Miss Nellie, without the least trace
      of coquetry. &ldquo;Is the wedding or the hanging to take place first, or
      together, so he can officiate at both?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His share in the Union Ditch is worth a hundred thousand dollars,&rdquo;
       continued her father; &ldquo;and if he isn't nominated for district judge this
      fall, he's bound to go to the legislature, anyway. I don't think a girl
      with your advantages and education can afford to throw away the chance of
      shining in Sacramento, San Francisco, or, in good time, perhaps even
      Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nellie's eyes did not reflect entire disapproval of this suggestion,
      although she replied with something of her father's practical quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dunn is not out of his bed yet, and they say Teresa's got away to
      Arizona, so there isn't any particular hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not; but see here, Nellie, I've some important news for you. You
      know your young friend of the Carquinez Woods&mdash;Dorman, the botanist,
      eh? Well, Brace knows all about him. And what do you think he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nellie took upon herself a few extra degrees of cold, and didn't
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Injin! Yes, an out-and-out Cherokee. You see he calls himself Dorman&mdash;Low
      Dorman. That's only French for 'Sleeping Water,' his Injin name!&mdash;'Low
      Dorman.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean 'L'Eau Dormante,'&rdquo; said Nellie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I said. The chief called him 'Sleeping Water' when he was a
      boy, and one of them French Canadian trappers translated it into French
      when he brought him to California to school. But he's an Injin, sure. No
      wonder he prefers to live in the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Nellie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; echoed her father impatiently, &ldquo;he's an Injin, I tell you, and you
      can't of course have anything to do with him. He mustn't come here again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you forget,&rdquo; said Nellie imperturbably, &ldquo;that it was you who invited
      him here, and were so much exercised over him. You remember you introduced
      him to the Bishop and those Eastern clergymen as a magnificent specimen of
      a young Californian. You forget what an occasion you made of his coming to
      church on Sunday, and how you made him come in his buckskin shirt and walk
      down the street with you after service!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the Rev. Mr. Wynn, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Nellie carelessly, &ldquo;how you made us sing out of the same
      book 'Children of our Father's Fold,' and how you preached at him until he
      actually got a color!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;but it wasn't known then he was an Injin, and
      they are frightfully unpopular with those Southwestern men among whom we
      labor. Indeed, I am quite convinced that when Brace said 'the only good
      Indian was a dead one' his expression, though extravagant, perhaps, really
      voiced the sentiments of the majority. It would be only kindness to the
      unfortunate creature to warn him from exposing himself to their rude but
      conscientious antagonism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you'd better tell him, then, in your own popular way, which they
      all seem to understand so well,&rdquo; responded the daughter. Mr. Wynn cast a
      quick glance at her, but there was no trace of irony in her face&mdash;nothing
      but a half-bored indifference as she walked toward the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with you to the coach-office,&rdquo; said her father, who generally
      gave these simple paternal duties the pronounced character of a public
      Christian example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's hardly worth while,&rdquo; replied Miss Nellie. &ldquo;I've to stop at the
      Watsons', at the foot of the hill, and ask after the baby; so I shall go
      on to the Crossing and pick up the coach when it passes. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, as soon as Nellie had departed, the Rev. Mr. Wynn proceeded
      to the coach-office, and publicly grasping the hand of Yuba Bill, the
      driver, commended his daughter to his care in the name of the universal
      brotherhood of man and the Christian fraternity. Carried away by his
      heartiness, he forgot his previous caution, and confided to the expressman
      Miss Nellie's regrets that she was not to have that gentleman's company.
      The result was that Miss Nellie found the coach with its passengers
      awaiting her with uplifted hats and wreathed smiles at the Crossing, and
      the box seat (from which an unfortunate stranger, who had expensively paid
      for it, had been summarily ejected) at her service beside Yuba Bill, who
      had thrown away his cigar and donned a new pair of buckskin gloves to do
      her honor. But a more serious result to the young beauty was the effect of
      the Rev. Mr. Wynn's confidences upon the impulsive heart of Jack Brace,
      the expressman. It has been already intimated that it was his &ldquo;day off.&rdquo;
       Unable to summarily reassume his usual functions beside the driver without
      some practical reason, and ashamed to go so palpably as a mere passenger,
      he was forced to let the coach proceed without him. Discomfited for the
      moment, he was not, however, beaten. He had lost the blissful journey by
      her side, which would have been his professional right, but&mdash;she was
      going to Indian Spring! could he not anticipate her there? Might they not
      meet in the most accidental manner? And what might not come from that
      meeting away from the prying eyes of their own town? Mr. Brace did not
      hesitate, but saddling his fleet Buckskin, by the time the stage-coach had
      passed the Crossing in the high-road he had mounted the hill and was
      dashing along the &ldquo;cutoff&rdquo; in the same direction, a full mile in advance.
      Arriving at Indian Spring, he left his horse at a Mexican posada on the
      confines of the settlement, and from the piled debris of a tunnel
      excavation awaited the slow arrival of the coach. On mature reflection he
      could give no reason why he had not boldly awaited it at the express
      office, except a certain bashful consciousness of his own folly, and a
      belief that it might be glaringly apparent to the bystanders. When the
      coach arrived and he had overcome this consciousness, it was too late.
      Yuba Bill had discharged his passengers for Indian Spring and driven away.
      Miss Nellie was in the settlement, but where? As time passed he became
      more desperate and bolder. He walked recklessly up and down the main
      street, glancing in at the open doors of shops, and even in the windows of
      private dwellings. It might have seemed a poor compliment to Miss Nellie,
      but it was an evidence of his complete preoccupation, when the sight of a
      female face at a window, even though it was plain or perhaps painted,
      caused his heart to bound, or the glancing of a skirt in the distance
      quickened his feet and his pulses. Had Jack contented himself with
      remaining at Excelsior he might have vaguely regretted, but as soon become
      as vaguely accustomed to, Miss Nellie's absence. But it was not until his
      hitherto quiet and passive love took this first step of action that it
      fully declared itself. When he had made the tour of the town a dozen times
      unsuccessfully, he had perfectly made up his mind that marriage with
      Nellie or the speedy death of several people, including possibly himself,
      was the only alternative. He regretted he had not accompanied her; he
      regretted he had not demanded where she was going; he contemplated a
      course of future action that two hours ago would have filled him with
      bashful terror. There was clearly but one thing to do&mdash;to declare his
      passion the instant he met her, and return with her to Excelsior an
      accepted suitor, or not to return at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he was vexatiously conscious of hearing his name lazily called,
      and looking up found that he was on the outskirts of the town, and
      interrogated by two horsemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got down to walk, and the coach got away from you, Jack, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little ashamed of his preoccupation, Brace stammered something about
      &ldquo;collections.&rdquo; He did not recognize the men, but his own face, name, and
      business were familiar to everybody for fifty miles along the stage-road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can settle a bet for us, I reckon. Bill Dacre thar bet me five
      dollars and the drinks that a young gal we met at the edge of the
      Carquinez Woods, dressed in a long brown duster and half muffled up in a
      hood, was the daughter of Father Wynn of Excelsior. I did not get a fair
      look at her, but it stands to reason that a high-toned young lady like
      Nellie Wynn don't go trap'sing along the wood like a Pike County tramp. I
      took the bet. May be you know if she's here or in Excelsior?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brace felt himself turning pale with eagerness and excitement. But the
      near prospect of seeing her presently gave him back his caution, and he
      answered truthfully that he had left her in Excelsior, and that in his two
      hours' sojourn in Indian Spring he had not met her once. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added,
      with a Californian's reverence for the sanctity of a bet, &ldquo;I reckon you'd
      better make it a stand-off for twenty-four hours, and I'll find out and
      let you know.&rdquo; Which, it is only fair to say, he honestly intended to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a hurried nod of parting, he continued in the direction of the Woods.
      When he had satisfied himself that the strangers had entered the
      settlement, and would not follow him for further explanation, he quickened
      his pace. In half an hour he passed between two of the gigantic sentinels
      that guarded the entrance to a trail. Here he paused to collect his
      thoughts. The Woods were vast in extent, the trail dim and uncertain&mdash;at
      times apparently breaking off, or intersecting another trail as faint as
      itself. Believing that Miss Nellie had diverged from the highway only as a
      momentary excursion into the shade, and that she would not dare to
      penetrate its more sombre and unknown recesses, he kept within sight of
      the skirting plain. By degrees the sedate influence of the silent vaults
      seemed to depress him. The ardor of the chase began to flag. Under the
      calm of their dim roof the fever of his veins began to subside; his pace
      slackened; he reasoned more deliberately. It was by no means probable that
      the young woman in a brown duster was Nellie; it was not her habitual
      traveling dress; it was not like her to walk unattended in the road; there
      was nothing in her tastes and habits to take her into this gloomy forest,
      allowing that she had even entered it; and on this absolute question of
      her identity the two witnesses were divided. He stopped irresolutely, and
      cast a last, long, half-despairing look around him. Hitherto he had given
      that part of the wood nearest the plain his greatest attention. His glance
      now sought its darker recesses. Suddenly he became breathless. Was it a
      beam of sunlight that had pierced the groined roof above, and now rested
      against the trunk of one of the dimmer, more secluded giants? No, it was
      moving; even as he gazed it slipped away, glanced against another tree,
      passed across one of the vaulted aisles, and then was lost again. Brief as
      was the glimpse, he was not mistaken&mdash;it was the figure of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment he was on her track, and soon had the satisfaction of
      seeing her reappear at a lesser distance. But the continual intervention
      of the massive trunks made the chase by no means an easy one, and as he
      could not keep her always in sight he was unable to follow or understand
      the one intelligent direction which she seemed to invariably keep.
      Nevertheless, he gained upon her breathlessly, and, thanks to the
      bark-strewn floor, noiselessly. He was near enough to distinguish and
      recognize the dress she wore, a pale yellow, that he had admired when he
      first saw her. It was Nellie, unmistakably; if it were she of the brown
      duster, she had discarded it, perhaps for greater freedom. He was near
      enough to call out now, but a sudden nervous timidity overcame him; his
      lips grew dry. What should he say to her? How account for his presence?
      &ldquo;Miss Nellie, one moment!&rdquo; he gasped. She darted forward and&mdash;vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he was not more than a dozen yards from her. He rushed to
      where she had been standing, but her disappearance was perfect and
      complete. He made a circuit of the group of trees within whose radius she
      had last appeared, but there was neither trace of her, nor a suggestion of
      her mode of escape. He called aloud to her; the vacant Woods let his
      helpless voice die in their unresponsive depths. He gazed into the air and
      down at the bark-strewn carpet at his feet. Like most of his vocation, he
      was sparing of speech, and epigrammatic after his fashion. Comprehending
      in one swift but despairing flash of intelligence the existence of some
      fateful power beyond his own weak endeavor, he accepted its logical result
      with characteristic grimness, threw his hat upon the ground, put his hands
      in his pockets, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm d&mdash;d!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Out of compliment to Miss Nellie Wynn, Yuba Bill, on reaching Indian
      Spring, had made a slight detour to enable him to ostentatiously set down
      his fair passenger before the door of the Burnhams. When it had closed on
      the admiring eyes of the passengers and the coach had rattled away, Miss
      Nellie, without any undue haste or apparent change in her usual quiet
      demeanor, managed, however, to dispatch her business promptly, and,
      leaving an impression that she would call again before her return to
      Excelsior, parted from her friends and slipped away through a side street
      to the General Furnishing Store of Indian Spring. In passing this
      emporium, Miss Nellie's quick eye had discovered a cheap brown linen
      duster hanging in its window. To purchase it, and put it over her delicate
      cambric dress, albeit with a shivering sense that she looked like a badly
      folded brown-paper parcel, did not take long. As she left the shop it was
      with mixed emotions of chagrin and security that she noticed that her
      passage through the settlement no longer turned the heads of its male
      inhabitants. She reached the outskirts of Indian Spring and the high-road
      at about the time Mr. Brace had begun his fruitless patrol of the main
      street. Far in the distance a faint olive-green table mountain seemed to
      rise abruptly from the plain. It was the Carquinez Woods. Gathering her
      spotless skirts beneath her extemporized brown domino, she set out briskly
      towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her progress was scarcely free or exhilarating. She was not accustomed
      to walking in a country where &ldquo;buggy-riding&rdquo; was considered the only
      genteel young-lady-like mode of progression, and its regular provision the
      expected courtesy of mankind. Always fastidiously booted, her
      low-quartered shoes were charming to the eye, but hardly adapted to the
      dust and inequalities of the highroad. It was true that she had thought of
      buying a coarser pair at Indian Spring, but once face to face with their
      uncompromising ugliness, she had faltered and fled. The sun was
      unmistakably hot, but her parasol was too well known and offered too
      violent a contrast to the duster for practical use. Once she stopped with
      an exclamation of annoyance, hesitated, and looked back. In half an hour
      she had twice lost her shoe and her temper; a pink flush took possession
      of her cheeks, and her eyes were bright with suppressed rage. Dust began
      to form grimy circles around their orbits; with cat-like shivers she even
      felt it pervade the roots of her blond hair. Gradually her breath grew
      more rapid and hysterical, her smarting eyes became humid, and at last,
      encountering two observant horsemen in the road, she turned and fled,
      until, reaching the wood, she began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she waited for the two horsemen to pass, to satisfy herself
      that she was not followed; then pushed on vaguely, until she reached a
      fallen tree, where, with a gesture of disgust, she tore off her hapless
      duster and flung it on the ground. She then sat down sobbing, but after a
      moment dried her eyes hurriedly and started to her feet. A few paces
      distant, erect, noiseless, with outstretched hand, the young solitary of
      the Carquinez Woods advanced towards her. His hand had almost touched
      hers, when he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; he asked gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said, turning half away, and searching the ground with her
      eyes, as if she had lost something. &ldquo;Only I must be going back now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall go back at once, if you wish it,&rdquo; he said, flushing slightly.
      &ldquo;But you have been crying; why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank as Miss Nellie wished to be, she could not bring herself to say that
      her feet hurt her, and the dust and heat were ruining her complexion. It
      was therefore with a half-confident belief that her troubles were really
      of a moral quality that she answered, &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing, but&mdash;but&mdash;it's
      wrong to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did not think it was wrong when you agreed to come, at our last
      meeting,&rdquo; said the young man, with that persistent logic which exasperates
      the inconsequent feminine mind. &ldquo;It cannot be any more wrong to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was not so far off,&rdquo; murmured the young girl, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the distance makes it more improper, then,&rdquo; he said abstractedly; but
      after a moment's contemplation of her half-averted face, he asked gravely,
      &ldquo;Has anyone talked to you about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes before, Nellie had been burning to unburthen herself of her
      father's warning, but now she felt she would not. &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't
      call yourself Low,&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's my name,&rdquo; he replied quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! It's only a stupid translation of a stupid nickname. They might
      as well call you 'Water' at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said you liked it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so I do. But don't you see&mdash;I&mdash;oh dear! you don't
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low did not reply, but turned his head with resigned gravity towards the
      deeper woods. Grasping the barrel of his rifle with his left hand, he
      threw his right arm across his left wrist and leaned slightly upon it with
      the habitual ease of a Western hunter&mdash;doubly picturesque in his own
      lithe, youthful symmetry. Miss Nellie looked at him from under her
      eyelids, and then half defiantly raised her head and her dark lashes.
      Gradually an almost magical change came over her features; her eyes grew
      larger and more and more yearning, until they seemed to draw and absorb in
      their liquid depths the figure of the young man before her; her cold face
      broke into an ecstasy of light and color; her humid lips parted in a
      bright, welcoming smile, until, with an irresistible impulse, she arose,
      and throwing back her head stretched towards him two hands full of vague
      and trembling passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment he had seized them, kissed them, and, as he drew her
      closer to his embrace, felt them tighten around his neck. &ldquo;But what name
      do you wish to call me?&rdquo; he asked, looking down into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nellie murmured something confidentially to the third button of his
      hunting shirt. &ldquo;But that,&rdquo; he replied, with a smile, &ldquo;THAT wouldn't be any
      more practical, and you wouldn't want others to call me dar&mdash;&rdquo; Her
      fingers loosened around his neck, she drew her head back, and a singular
      expression passed over her face, which to any calmer observer than a lover
      would have seemed, however, to indicate more curiosity than jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else DOES call you so?&rdquo; she added earnestly. &ldquo;How many, for
      instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low's reply was addressed not to her ear, but her lips. She did not avoid
      it, but added, &ldquo;And do you kiss them all like that?&rdquo; Taking him by the
      shoulders, she held him a little way from her, and gazed at him from head
      to foot. Then drawing him again to her embrace, she said, &ldquo;I don't care,
      at least no woman has kissed you like that.&rdquo; Happy, dazzled, and
      embarrassed, he was beginning to stammer the truthful protestation that
      rose to his lips, but she stopped him: &ldquo;No, don't protest! say nothing!
      Let ME love YOU&mdash;that is all. It is enough.&rdquo; He would have caught her
      in his arms again, but she drew back. &ldquo;We are near the road,&rdquo; she said
      quietly. &ldquo;Come! You promised to show me where you camped. Let US make the
      most of our holiday. In an hour I must leave the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall accompany you, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must go as I came&mdash;alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Nellie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you no,&rdquo; she said, with an almost harsh practical decision,
      incompatible with her previous abandonment. &ldquo;We might be seen together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose we are; we must be seen together eventually,&rdquo; he
      remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl made an involuntary gesture of impatient negation, but
      checked herself. &ldquo;Don't let us talk of that now. Come, while I am here
      under your own roof&mdash;&rdquo; she pointed to the high interlaced boughs
      above them&mdash;&ldquo;you must be hospitable. Show me your home; tell me,
      isn't it a little gloomy sometimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never has been; I never thought it WOULD be until the moment you leave
      it to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed his hand briefly and in a half-perfunctory way, as if her
      vanity had accepted and dismissed the compliment. &ldquo;Take me somewhere,&rdquo; she
      said inquisitively, &ldquo;where you stay most; I do not seem to see you HERE,&rdquo;
       she added, looking around her with a slight shiver. &ldquo;It is so big and so
      high. Have you no place where you eat and rest and sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except in the rainy season, I camp all over the place&mdash;at any spot
      where I may have been shooting or collecting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Collecting?&rdquo; queried Nellie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; with the herbarium, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nellie dubiously. &ldquo;But you told me once&mdash;the first time
      we ever talked together,&rdquo; she added, looking in his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;something
      about your keeping your things like a squirrel in a tree. Could we not go
      there? Is there not room for us to sit and talk without being brow-beaten
      and looked down upon by these supercilious trees?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too far away,&rdquo; said Low truthfully, but with a somewhat pronounced
      emphasis, &ldquo;much too far for you just now; and it lies on another trail
      that enters the wood beyond. But come, I will show you a spring known only
      to myself, the wood ducks, and the squirrels. I discovered it the first
      day I saw you, and gave it your name. But you shall christen it yourself.
      It will be all yours, and yours alone, for it is so hidden and secluded
      that I defy any feet but my own or whoso shall keep step with mine to find
      it. Shall that foot be yours, Nellie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face beamed with a bright assent. &ldquo;It may be difficult to track it
      from here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but stand where you are a moment, and don't move,
      rustle, nor agitate the air in any way. The woods are still now.&rdquo; He
      turned at right angles with the trail, moved a few paces into the ferns
      and underbrush, and then stopped with his finger on his lips. For an
      instant both remained motionless; then with his intent face bent forward
      and both arms extended, he began to sink slowly upon one knee and one
      side, inclining his body with a gentle, perfectly-graduated movement until
      his ear almost touched the ground. Nellie watched his graceful figure
      breathlessly, until, like a bow unbent, he stood suddenly erect again, and
      beckoned to her without changing the direction of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I have found it,&rdquo; he continued, moving forward without turning
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how? What did you kneel for?&rdquo; He did not reply, but taking her hand
      in his continued to move slowly on through the underbrush, as if obeying
      some magnetic attraction. &ldquo;How did you find it?&rdquo; again asked the half-awed
      girl, her voice unconsciously falling to a whisper. Still silent, Low kept
      his rigid face and forward tread for twenty yards further; then he stopped
      and released the girl's half-impatient hand. &ldquo;How did you find it?&rdquo; she
      repeated sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my ears and nose,&rdquo; replied Low gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your nose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I smelt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still fresh with the memory of his picturesque attitude, the young man's
      reply seemed to involve something more irritating to her feelings than
      even that absurd anticlimax. She looked at him coldly and critically, and
      appeared to hesitate whether to proceed. &ldquo;Is it far?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than ten minutes now, as I shall go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won't have to smell your way again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is quite plain now,&rdquo; he answered seriously, the young girl's
      sarcasm slipping harmlessly from his Indian stolidity. &ldquo;Don't you smell it
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Nellie's thin, cold nostrils refused to take that vulgar
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor hear it? Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget I suffer the misfortune of having been brought up under a
      roof,&rdquo; she replied coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; repeated Low, in all seriousness; &ldquo;it's not your fault. But
      do you know, I sometimes think I am peculiarly sensitive to water; I feel
      it miles away. At night, though I may not see it or even know where it is,
      I am conscious of it. It is company to me when I am alone, and I seem to
      hear it in my dreams. There is no music as sweet to me as its song. When
      you sang with me that day in church, I seemed to hear it ripple in your
      voice. It says to me more than the birds do, more than the rarest plants I
      find. It seems to live with me and for me. It is my earliest recollection;
      I know it will be my last, for I shall die in its embrace. Do you think,
      Nellie,&rdquo; he continued, stopping short and gazing earnestly in her face&mdash;&ldquo;do
      you think that the chiefs knew this when they called me 'Sleeping Water'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Miss Nellie's several gifts I fear the gods had not added poetry. A
      slight knowledge of English verse of a select character, unfortunately,
      did not assist her in the interpretation of the young man's speech, nor
      relieve her from the momentary feeling that he was at times deficient in
      intellect. She preferred, however, to take a personal view of the
      question, and expressed her sarcastic regret that she had not known before
      that she had been indebted to the great flume and ditch at Excelsior for
      the pleasure of his acquaintance. This pert remark occasioned some
      explanation, which ended in the girl's accepting a kiss in lieu of more
      logical argument. Nevertheless, she was still conscious of an inward
      irritation&mdash;always distinct from her singular and perfectly material
      passion&mdash;which found vent as the difficulties of their undeviating
      progress through the underbrush increased. At last she lost her shoe
      again, and stopped short. &ldquo;It's a pity your Indian friends did not
      christen you 'Wild Mustard' or 'Clover,'&rdquo; she said satirically, &ldquo;that you
      might have had some sympathies and longings for the open fields instead of
      these horrid jungles! I know we will not get back in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Low accepted this speech literally and with his remorseless
      gravity. &ldquo;If my name annoys you, I can get it changed by the legislature,
      you know, and I can find out what my father's name was, and take that. My
      mother, who died in giving me birth, was the daughter of a chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your mother was really an Indian?&rdquo; said Nellie, &ldquo;and you are&mdash;&rdquo;
       She stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I told you all this the day we first met,&rdquo; said Low, with grave
      astonishment. &ldquo;Don't you remember our long talk coming from church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Nellie coldly, &ldquo;you didn't tell me.&rdquo; But she was obliged to
      drop her eyes before the unwavering, undeniable truthfulness of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten,&rdquo; he said calmly; &ldquo;but it is only right you should
      have your own way in disposing of a name that I have cared little for; and
      as you're to have a share of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it's getting late, and if we are not going forward&mdash;&rdquo;
       interrupted the girl impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ARE going forward,&rdquo; said Low imperturbably; &ldquo;but I wanted to tell you,
      as we were speaking on THAT subject&rdquo; (Nellie looked at her watch), &ldquo;I've
      been offered the place of botanist and naturalist in Professor Grant's
      survey of Mount Shasta, and if I take it&mdash;why, when I come back,
      darling&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're not going just yet,&rdquo; broke in Nellie, with a new expression in
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we need not talk of it now,&rdquo; she said, with animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sudden vivacity relieved him. &ldquo;I see what's the matter,&rdquo; he said
      gently, looking down at her feet; &ldquo;these little shoes were not made to
      keep step with a moccasin. We must try another way.&rdquo; He stooped as if to
      secure the erring buskin, but suddenly lifted her like a child to his
      shoulder. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he continued, placing her arm round his neck, &ldquo;you are
      clear of the ferns and brambles now, and we can go on. Are you
      comfortable?&rdquo; He looked up, read her answer in her burning eyes and the
      warm lips pressed to his forehead at the roots of his straight dark hair,
      and again moved onward as in a mesmeric dream. But he did not swerve from
      his direct course, and with a final dash through the undergrowth parted
      the leafy curtain before the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the young girl was dazzled by the strong light that came from a
      rent in the interwoven arches of the wood. The breach had been caused by
      the huge bulk of one of the great giants that had half fallen, and was
      lying at a steep angle against one of its mightiest brethren, having borne
      down a lesser tree in the arc of its downward path. Two of the roots, as
      large as younger trees, tossed their blackened and bare limbs high in the
      air. The spring&mdash;the insignificant cause of this vast disruption&mdash;gurgled,
      flashed, and sparkled at the base; the limpid baby fingers that had laid
      bare the foundations of that fallen column played with the still clinging
      rootlets, laved the fractured and twisted limbs, and, widening, filled
      with sleeping water the graves from which they had been torn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had been going on for years, down there,&rdquo; said Low, pointing to a
      cavity from which the fresh water now slowly welled, &ldquo;but it had been
      quickened by the rising of the subterranean springs and rivers which
      always occurs at a certain stage of the dry season. I remember that on
      that very night&mdash;for it happened a little after midnight, when all
      sounds are more audible&mdash;I was troubled and oppressed in my sleep by
      what you would call a nightmare; a feeling as if I was kept down by bonds
      and pinions that I longed to break. And then I heard a crash in this
      direction, and the first streak of morning brought me the sound and scent
      of water. Six months afterwards I chanced to find my way here, as I told
      you, and gave it your name. I did not dream that I should ever stand
      beside it with you, and have you christen it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unloosened the cup from his flask, and filling it at the spring handed
      it to her. But the young girl leant over the pool, and pouring the water
      idly back said, &ldquo;I'd rather put my feet in it. Mayn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; he said wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My feet are SO hot and dusty. The water looks deliciously cool. May I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away as Nellie, with apparent unconsciousness, seated herself on
      the bank, and removed her shoes and stockings. When she had dabbled her
      feet a few moments in the pool, she said over her shoulder&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can talk just as well, can't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, why didn't you come to church more often, and why didn't you
      think of telling father that you were convicted of sin and wanted to be
      baptized?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; hesitated the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you lost the chance of having father convert you, baptize you, and
      take you into full church fellowship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never thought. Aren't you a Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He supposes so! Have you no convictions&mdash;no profession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Nellie, I never thought that you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never thought that I&mdash;what? Do you think that I could ever be
      anything to a man who did not believe in justification by faith, or in the
      covenant of church fellowship? Do you think father would let me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his eagerness to defend himself he stepped to her side. But seeing her
      little feet shining through the dark water, like outcroppings of
      delicately veined quartz, he stopped embarrassed. Miss Nellie, however,
      leaped to one foot, and, shaking the other over the pool, put her hand on
      his shoulder to steady herself. &ldquo;You haven't got a towel&mdash;or,&rdquo; she
      said dubiously, looking at her small handkerchief, &ldquo;anything to dry them
      on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Low did not, as she perhaps expected, offer his own handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you take a bath after our fashion,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;you must learn
      to dry yourself after our fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lifting her again lightly in his arms, he carried her a few steps to the
      sunny opening, and bade her bury her feet in the dried mosses and baked
      withered grasses that were bleaching in a hollow. The young girl uttered a
      cry of childish delight, as the soft ciliated fibres touched her sensitive
      skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is healing, too,&rdquo; continued Low; &ldquo;a moccasin filled with it after a
      day on the trail makes you all right again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Nellie seemed to be thinking of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the way the squaws bathe and dry themselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; you forget I was a boy when I left them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're sure you never knew any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl seemed to derive some satisfaction in moving her feet up
      and down for several minutes among the grasses in the hollow; then, after
      a pause, said, &ldquo;You are quite certain I am the first woman that ever
      touched this spring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only the first woman, but the first human being, except myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had taken each other's hands; seated side by side, they leaned
      against a curving elastic root that half supported, half encompassed,
      them. The girl's capricious, fitful manner succumbed as before to the near
      contact of her companion. Looking into her eyes, Low fell into a sweet,
      selfish lover's monologue, descriptive of his past and present feelings
      towards her, which she accepted with a heightened color, a slight exchange
      of sentiment, and a strange curiosity. The sun had painted their
      half-embraced silhouettes against the slanting tree-trunk, and began to
      decline unnoticed; the ripple of the water mingling with their whispers
      came as one sound to the listening ear; even their eloquent silences were
      as deep, and, I wot, perhaps as dangerous, as the darkened pool that
      filled so noiselessly a dozen yards away. So quiet were they that the
      tremor of invading wings once or twice shook the silence, or the quick
      scamper of frightened feet rustled the dead grass. But in the midst of a
      prolonged stillness the young man sprang up so suddenly that Nellie was
      still half clinging to his neck as he stood erect. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he whispered;
      &ldquo;some one is near!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disengaged her anxious hands gently, leaped upon the slanting
      tree-trunk, and running half-way up its incline with the agility of a
      squirrel, stretched himself at full length upon it and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the impatient, inexplicably startled girl, it seemed an age before he
      rejoined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are safe,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he is going by the western trail towards Indian
      Spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is HE?&rdquo; she asked, biting her lips with a poorly restrained gesture
      of mortification and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some stranger,&rdquo; replied Low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as he wasn't coming here, why did you give me such a fright?&rdquo; she
      said pettishly. &ldquo;Are you nervous because a single wayfarer happens to
      stray here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no wayfarer, for he tried to keep near the trail,&rdquo; said Low. &ldquo;He
      was a stranger to the wood, for he lost his way every now and then. He was
      seeking or expecting some one, for he stopped frequently and waited or
      listened. He had not walked far, for he wore spurs that tinkled and caught
      in the brush; and yet he had not ridden here, for no horse's hoofs passed
      the road since we have been here. He must have come from Indian Spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you heard all that when you listened just now?&rdquo; asked Nellie, half
      disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impervious to her incredulity Low turned his calm eyes on her face.
      &ldquo;Certainly, I'll bet my life on what I say. Tell me: do you know anybody
      in Indian Spring who would likely spy upon you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl was conscious of a certain ill-defined uneasiness, but
      answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was not YOU he was seeking,&rdquo; said Low thoughtfully. Miss Nellie
      had not time to notice the emphasis, for he added, &ldquo;You must go at once,
      and lest you have been followed I will show you another way back to Indian
      Spring. It is longer, and you must hasten. Take your shoes and stockings
      with you until we are out of the bush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised her again in his arms and strode once more out through the
      covert into the dim aisles of the wood. They spoke but little; she could
      not help feeling that some other discordant element, affecting him more
      strongly than it did her, had come between them, and was half perplexed
      and half frightened. At the end of ten minutes he seated her upon a fallen
      branch, and telling her he would return by the time she had resumed her
      shoes and stockings glided from her like a shadow. She would have uttered
      an indignant protest at being left alone, but he was gone ere she could
      detain him. For a moment she thought she hated him. But when she had
      mechanically shod herself once more, not without nervous shivers at every
      falling needle, he was at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anyone who wears a frieze coat like that?&rdquo; he asked, handing
      her a few torn shreds of wool affixed to a splinter of bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nellie instantly recognized the material of a certain sporting coat
      worn by Mr. Jack Brace on festive occasions, but a strange yet infallible
      instinct that was part of her nature made her instantly disclaim all
      knowledge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not anyone who scents himself with some doctor's stuff like cologne?&rdquo;
       continued Low, with the disgust of keen olfactory sensibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Miss Nellie recognized the perfume with which the gallant expressman
      was wont to make redolent her little parlor, but again she avowed no
      knowledge of its possessor. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Low with some disappointment,
      &ldquo;such a man has been here. Be on your guard. Let us go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She required no urging to hasten her steps, but hurried breathlessly at
      his side. He had taken a new trail by which they left the wood at right
      angles with the highway, two miles away. Following an almost effaced mule
      track along a slight depression of the plain, deep enough, however, to
      hide them from view, he accompanied her, until, rising to the level again,
      she saw they were beginning to approach the highway and the distant roofs
      of Indian Spring. &ldquo;Nobody meeting you now,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;would suspect
      where you had been. Good night! until next week&mdash;remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They pressed each other's hands, and standing on the slight ridge outlined
      against the paling sky, in full view of the highway, parting carelessly,
      as if they had been chance met travelers. But Nellie could not restrain a
      parting backward glance as she left the ridge. Low had descended to the
      deserted trail, and was running swiftly in the direction of the Carquinez
      Woods.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Teresa awoke with a start. It was day already, but how far advanced the
      even, unchanging, soft twilight of the woods gave no indication. Her
      companion had vanished, and to her bewildered senses so had the camp-fire,
      even to its embers and ashes. Was she awake, or had she wandered away
      unconsciously in the night? One glance at the tree above her dissipated
      the fancy. There was the opening of her quaint retreat and the hanging
      strips of bark, and at the foot of the opposite tree lay the carcass of
      the bear. It had been skinned, and, as Teresa thought with an inward
      shiver, already looked half its former size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not yet accustomed to the fact that a few steps in either direction around
      the circumference of those great trunks produced the sudden appearance or
      disappearance of any figure, Teresa uttered a slight scream as her young
      companion unexpectedly stepped to her side. &ldquo;You see a change here,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;the stamped-out ashes of the camp-fire lie under the brush,&rdquo; and he
      pointed to some cleverly scattered boughs and strips of bark which
      completely effaced the traces of last night's bivouac. &ldquo;We can't afford to
      call the attention of any packer or hunter who might straggle this way to
      this particular spot and this particular tree; the more naturally,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;as they always prefer to camp over an old fire.&rdquo; Accepting this
      explanation meekly, as partly a reproach for her caprice of the previous
      night, Teresa hung her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but wouldn't that,&rdquo; pointing to the carcass
      of the bear, &ldquo;have made them curious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Low's logic was relentless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time there would have been little left to excite curiosity, if
      you had been willing to leave those beasts to their work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very sorry,&rdquo; repeated the woman, her lips quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the scavengers of the wood,&rdquo; he continued in a lighter tone; &ldquo;if
      you stay here you must try to use them to keep your house clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa smiled nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that they shall finish their work to-night,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and I
      shall build another camp-fire for us a mile from here until they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Teresa caught his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, &ldquo;don't, please, for me. You must not take the
      trouble, nor the risk. Hear me; do, please. I can bear it, I WILL bear it&mdash;to-night.
      I would have borne it last night, but it was so strange&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;she
      passed her hands over her forehead&mdash;&ldquo;I think I must have been half
      mad. But I am not so foolish now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed so broken and despondent that he replied reassuringly: &ldquo;Perhaps
      it would be better that I should find another hiding-place for you, until
      I can dispose of that carcass so that it will not draw dogs after the
      wolves, and men after THEM. Besides, your friend the sheriff will probably
      remember the bear when he remembers anything, and try to get on its track
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a conceited fool,&rdquo; broke in Teresa in a high voice, with a slight
      return of her old fury, &ldquo;or he'd have guessed where that shot came from;
      and,&rdquo; she added in a lower tone, looking down at her limp and nerveless
      fingers, &ldquo;he wouldn't have let a poor, weak, nervous wretch like me get
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But his deputy may put two and two together, and connect your escape with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa's eyes flashed. &ldquo;It would be like the dog, just to save his pride,
      to swear it was an ambush of my friends, and that he was overpowered by
      numbers. Oh yes! I see it all!&rdquo; she almost screamed, lashing herself into
      a rage at the bare contemplation of this diminution of her glory. &ldquo;That's
      the dirty lie he tells everywhere, and is telling now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stamped her feet and glanced savagely around, as if at any risk to
      proclaim the falsehood. Low turned his impassive, truthful face towards
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheriff Dunn,&rdquo; he began gravely, &ldquo;is a politician, and a fool when he
      takes to the trail as a hunter of man or beast. But he is not a coward nor
      a liar. Your chances would be better if he were&mdash;if he laid your
      escape to an ambush of your friends, than if his pride held you alone
      responsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he's such a good man, why do you hesitate?&rdquo; she replied bitterly. &ldquo;Why
      don't you give me up at once, and do a service to one of your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not even know him,&rdquo; returned Low opening his clear eyes upon her.
      &ldquo;I've promised to hide you here, and I shall hide you as well from him as
      from anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa did not reply, but suddenly dropping down upon the ground buried
      her face in her hands and began to sob convulsively. Low turned
      impassively away, and putting aside the bark curtain climbed into the
      hollow tree. In a few moments he reappeared, laden with provisions and a
      few simple cooking utensils, and touched her lightly on the shoulder. She
      looked up timidly; the paroxysm had passed, but her lashes yet glittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come and get some breakfast. I find you have eaten
      nothing since you have been here&mdash;twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know it,&rdquo; she said, with a faint smile. Then seeing his burden,
      and possessed by a new and strange desire for some menial employment, she
      said hurriedly, &ldquo;Let me carry something&mdash;do, please,&rdquo; and even tried
      to disencumber him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half annoyed, Low at last yielded, and handing his rifle said, &ldquo;There,
      then, take that; but be careful&mdash;it's loaded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cruel blush burnt the woman's face to the roots of her hair as she took
      the weapon hesitatingly in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she stammered, hurriedly lifting her shame-suffused eyes to his;
      &ldquo;no! no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away with an impatience which showed her how completely
      gratuitous had been her agitation and its significance, and said, &ldquo;Well,
      then, give it back if you are afraid of it.&rdquo; But she as suddenly declined
      to return it; and shouldering it deftly, took her place by his side.
      Silently they moved from the hollow tree together.
    </p>
    <p>
      During their walk she did not attempt to invade his taciturnity.
      Nevertheless she was as keenly alive and watchful of his every movement
      and gesture as if she had hung enchanted on his lips. The unerring way
      with which he pursued a viewless, undeviating path through those trackless
      woods, his quick reconnaissance of certain trees or openings, his mute
      inspection of some almost imperceptible footprint of bird or beast, his
      critical examination of certain plants which he plucked and deposited in
      his deerskin haversack, were not lost on the quick-witted woman. As they
      gradually changed the clear, unencumbered aisles of the central woods for
      a more tangled undergrowth, Teresa felt that subtle admiration which
      culminates in imitation, and simulating perfectly the step, tread, and
      easy swing of her companion, followed so accurately his lead that she won
      a gratified exclamation from him when their goal was reached&mdash;a
      broken, blackened shaft, splintered by long-forgotten lightning, in the
      centre of a tangled carpet of wood-clover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't wonder you distanced the deputy,&rdquo; he said cheerfully, throwing
      down his burden, &ldquo;if you can take the hunting-path like that. In a few
      days, if you stay here, I can venture to trust you alone for a little
      pasear when you are tired of the tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa looked pleased, but busied herself with arrangements for the
      breakfast, while he gathered the fuel for the roaring fire which soon
      blazed beside the shattered tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa's breakfast was a success. It was a revelation to the young nomad,
      whose ascetic habits and simple tastes were usually content with the most
      primitive forms of frontier cookery. It was at least a surprise to him to
      know that without extra trouble kneaded flour, water, and saleratus need
      not be essentially heavy; that coffee need not be boiled with sugar to the
      consistency of syrup; that even that rarest delicacy, small shreds of
      venison covered with ashes and broiled upon the end of a ramrod boldly
      thrust into the flames, would be better and even more expeditiously cooked
      upon burning coals. Moved in his practical nature, he was surprised to
      find this curious creature of disorganized nerves and useless impulses
      informed with an intelligence that did not preclude the welfare of
      humanity or the existence of a soul. He respected her for some minutes,
      until in the midst of a culinary triumph a big tear dropped and spluttered
      in the saucepan. But he forgave the irrelevancy by taking no notice of it,
      and by doing full justice to that particular dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he asked several questions based upon these recently
      discovered qualities. It appeared that in the old days of her wanderings
      with the circus troupe she had often been forced to undertake this nomadic
      housekeeping. But she &ldquo;despised it,&rdquo; had never done it since, and always
      had refused to do it for &ldquo;him&rdquo;&mdash;the personal pronoun referring, as
      Low understood, to her lover, Curson. Not caring to revive these memories
      further, Low briefly concluded: &ldquo;I don't know what you were, or what you
      may be, but from what I see of you you've got all the sabe of a
      frontierman's wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and looked at him, and then with an impulse of imprudence that
      only half concealed a more serious vanity, asked, &ldquo;Do you think I might
      have made a good squaw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he replied quietly. &ldquo;I never saw enough of them to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa, confident from his clear eyes that he spoke the truth, but having
      nothing ready to follow this calm disposal of her curiosity, relapsed into
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal finished, Teresa washed their scant table equipage in a little
      spring near the camp-fire; where, catching sight of her disordered dress
      and collar, she rapidly threw her shawl, after the national fashion, over
      her shoulder and pinned it quickly. Low cached the remaining provisions
      and the few cooking utensils under the dead embers and ashes, obliterating
      all superficial indication of their camp-fire as deftly and artistically
      as he had before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't the ghost of a chance,&rdquo; he said in explanation, &ldquo;that anybody
      but you or I will set foot here before we come back to supper, but it's
      well to be on guard. I'll take you back to the cabin now, though I bet you
      could find your way there as well as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On their way back Teresa ran ahead of her companion, and plucking a few
      tiny leaves from a hidden oasis in the bark-strewn trail brought them to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the kind you're looking for, isn't it?&rdquo; she said, half timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; responded Low, in gratified surprise; &ldquo;but how did you know it?
      You're not a botanist, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon not,&rdquo; said Teresa; &ldquo;but you picked some when we came, and I
      noticed what they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was indeed another revelation. Low stopped and gazed at her with such
      frank, open, utterly unabashed curiosity that her black eyes fell before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think,&rdquo; he asked with logical deliberation, &ldquo;that you could
      find any plant from another I should give you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or from a drawing of it&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; perhaps even if you described it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A half-confidential, half-fraternal silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what. I've got a book&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; interrupted Teresa; &ldquo;full of these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you think you could&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I could,&rdquo; broke in Teresa, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't know what I mean,&rdquo; said the imperturbable Low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do. Why, find 'em, and preserve all the different ones for
      you to write under&mdash;that's it, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low nodded his head, gratified but not entirely convinced that she had
      fully estimated the magnitude of the endeavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Teresa, in the feminine postscriptum voice which it
      would seem entered even the philosophical calm of the aisles they were
      treading&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose that SHE places great value on them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low had indeed heard Science personified before, nor was it at all
      impossible that the singular woman walking by his side had also. He said
      &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; but added, in mental reference to the Linnean Society of San
      Francisco, that &ldquo;THEY were rather particular about the rarer kinds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Content as Teresa had been to believe in Low's tender relations with some
      favored ONE of her sex, this frank confession of a plural devotion
      staggered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued calmly. &ldquo;The Botanical Society I correspond with are
      more particular than the Government Survey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are doing this for a society?&rdquo; demanded Teresa, with a stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I'm making a collection and classification of specimens. I
      intend&mdash;but what are you looking at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa had suddenly turned away. Putting his hand lightly on her shoulder,
      the young man brought her face to face him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought all the while it was for a girl,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo; But
      here the mere effort of speech sent her off into an audible and genuine
      outburst of laughter. It was the first time he had seen her even smile
      other than bitterly. Characteristically unconscious of any humor in her
      error, he remained unembarrassed. But he could not help noticing a change
      in the expression of her face, her voice, and even her intonation. It
      seemed as if that fit of laughter had loosed the last ties that bound her
      to a self-imposed character, had swept away the last barrier between her
      and her healthier nature, had dispossessed a painful unreality, and
      relieved the morbid tension of a purely nervous attitude. The change in
      her utterance and the resumption of her softer Spanish accent seemed to
      have come with her confidences, and Low took leave of her before their
      sylvan cabin with a comrade's heartiness, and a complete forgetfulness
      that her voice had ever irritated him.

    <p>
      When he returned that afternoon he was startled to find the cabin empty.
      But instead of bearing any appearance of disturbance or hurried flight,
      the rude interior seemed to have magically assumed a decorous order and
      cleanliness unknown before. Fresh bark hid the inequalities of the floor.
      The skins and blankets were folded in the corners, the rude shelves were
      carefully arranged, even a few tall ferns and bright but quickly fading
      flowers were disposed around the blackened chimney. She had evidently
      availed herself of the change of clothing he had brought her, for her late
      garments were hanging from the hastily-devised wooden pegs driven in the
      wall. The young man gazed around him with mixed feelings of gratification
      and uneasiness. His presence had been dispossessed in a single hour; his
      ten years of lonely habitation had left no trace that this woman had not
      effaced with a deft move of her hand. More than that, it looked as if she
      had always occupied it; and it was with a singular conviction that even
      when she should occupy it no longer it would only revert to him as her
      dwelling that he dropped the bark shutters athwart the opening, and left
      it to follow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his quick ear, fine eye, and abnormal senses, this was easy enough. She
      had gone in the direction of this morning's camp. Once or twice he paused
      with a half-gesture of recognition and a characteristic &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; at the
      place where she had stopped, but was surprised to find that her main
      course had been as direct as his own. Deviating from this direct line with
      Indian precaution, he first made a circuit of the camp, and approached the
      shattered trunk from the opposite direction. He consequently came upon
      Teresa unawares. But the momentary astonishment and embarrassment were his
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scarcely recognized her. She was wearing the garments he had brought
      her the day before&mdash;a certain discarded gown of Miss Nellie Wynn,
      which he had hurriedly begged from her under the pretext of clothing the
      wife of a distressed overland emigrant then on the way to the mines.
      Although he had satisfied his conscience with the intention of confessing
      the pious fraud to her when Teresa was gone and safe from pursuit, it was
      not without a sense of remorse that he witnessed the sacrilegious
      transformation. The two women were nearly the same height and size; and
      although Teresa's maturer figure accented the outlines more strongly, it
      was still becoming enough to increase his irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this becomingness she was doubtless unaware at the moment that he
      surprised her. She was conscious of having &ldquo;a change,&rdquo; and this had
      emboldened her to &ldquo;do her hair&rdquo; and otherwise compose herself. After their
      greeting she was the first to allude to the dress, regretting that it was
      not more of a rough disguise, and that, as she must now discard the
      national habit of wearing her shawl &ldquo;manta&rdquo; fashion over her head, she
      wanted a hat. &ldquo;But you must not,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;borrow any more dresses for
      me from your young woman. Buy them for me at some shop. They left me
      enough money for that.&rdquo; Low gently put aside the few pieces of gold she
      had drawn from her pocket, and briefly reminded her of the suspicion such
      a purchase by him would produce. &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; she said, with a laugh.
      &ldquo;Caramba! what a mule I'm becoming! Ah! wait a moment. I have it! Buy me a
      common felt hat&mdash;a man's hat&mdash;as if for yourself, as a change to
      that animal,&rdquo; pointing to the fox-tailed cap he wore summer and winter,
      &ldquo;and I'll show you a trick. I haven't run a theatrical wardrobe for
      nothing.&rdquo; Nor had she, for the hat thus procured, a few days later,
      became, by the aid of a silk handkerchief and a bluejay's feather, a
      fascinating &ldquo;pork pie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever cause of annoyance to Low still lingered in Teresa's dress, it
      was soon forgotten in a palpable evidence of Teresa's value as a botanical
      assistant. It appeared that during the afternoon she had not only
      duplicated his specimens, but had discoverd one or two rare plants as yet
      unclassified in the flora of the Carquinez Woods. He was delighted, and in
      turn, over the campfire, yielded up some details of his present life and
      some of his earlier recollections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't remember anything of your father?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Did he ever try
      to seek you out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Why should he?&rdquo; replied the imperturbable Low; &ldquo;he was not a
      Cherokee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he was a beast,&rdquo; responded Teresa promptly. &ldquo;And your mother&mdash;do
      you remember her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think she died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You THINK she died? Don't you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you're another!&rdquo; said Teresa. Notwithstanding this frankness, they
      shook hands for the night: Teresa nestling like a rabbit in a hollow by
      the side of the campfire; Low with his feet towards it, Indian-wise, and
      his head and shoulders pillowed on his haversack, only half
      distinguishable in the darkness beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such trivial details three uneventful days slipped by. Their retreat
      was undisturbed, nor could Low detect, by the least evidence to his acute
      perceptive faculties, that any intruding feet had since crossed the belt
      of shade. The echoes of passing events at Indian Spring had recorded the
      escape of Teresa as occurring at a remote and purely imaginative distance,
      and her probable direction the county of Yolo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you remember,&rdquo; he one day asked her, &ldquo;what time it was when you cut
      the riata and got away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa pressed her hands upon her eyes and temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were here at seven; you could have covered some ground in four
      hours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;I don't know,&rdquo; she said, her voice taking up its old
      quality again. &ldquo;Don't ask me&mdash;I ran all the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face was quite pale as she removed her hands from her eyes, and her
      breath came as quickly as if she had just finished that race for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think I am safe here?&rdquo; she added, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly&mdash;until they find you are NOT in Yolo. Then they'll look
      here. And THAT'S the time for you to go THERE.&rdquo; Teresa smiled timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will take them some time to search Yolo&mdash;unless,&rdquo; she added,
      &ldquo;you're tired of me here.&rdquo; The charming non sequitur did not, however,
      seem to strike the young man. &ldquo;I've got time yet to find a few more plants
      for you,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And give you a few more lessons in cooking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conscientious and literal Low was beginning to doubt if she were
      really practical. How otherwise could she trifle with such a situation?
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be confessed that that day and the next she did trifle with it.
      She gave herself up to a grave and delicious languor that seemed to flow
      from shadow and silence and permeate her entire being. She passed hours in
      a thoughtful repose of mind and spirit that seemed to fall like balm from
      those steadfast guardians, and distill their gentle ether in her soul; or
      breathed into her listening ear immunity from the forgotten past, and
      security for the present. If there was no dream of the future in this
      calm, even recurrence of placid existence, so much the better. The simple
      details of each succeeding day, the quaint housekeeping, the brief
      companionship and coming and going of her young host&mdash;himself at best
      a crystallized personification of the sedate and hospitable woods&mdash;satisfied
      her feeble cravings. She no longer regretted the inferior position that
      her fears had obliged her to take the first night she came; she began to
      look up to this young man&mdash;so much younger than herself&mdash;without
      knowing what it meant; it was not until she found that this attitude did
      not detract from his picturesqueness that she discovered herself seeking
      for reasons to degrade him from this seductive eminence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week had elapsed with little change. On two days he had been absent all
      day, returning only in time to sup in the hollow tree, which, thanks to
      the final removal of the dead bear from its vicinity, was now considered a
      safer retreat than the exposed camp-fire. On the first of these occasions
      she received him with some preoccupation, paying but little heed to the
      scant gossip he brought from Indian Spring, and retiring early under the
      plea of fatigue, that he might seek his own distant camp-fire, which,
      thanks to her stronger nerves and regained courage, she no longer required
      so near. On the second occasion, he found her writing a letter more or
      less blotted with her tears. When it was finished, she begged him to post
      it at Indian Spring, where in two days an answer would be returned, under
      cover, to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will be satisfied then,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satisfied with what?&rdquo; queried the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll see,&rdquo; she replied, giving him her cold hand. &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can't you tell me now?&rdquo; he remonstrated, retaining her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait two days longer&mdash;it isn't much,&rdquo; was all she vouchsafed to
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two days passed. Their former confidence and good fellowship were
      fully restored when the morning came on which he was to bring the answer
      from the post-office at Indian Spring. He had talked again of his future,
      and had recorded his ambition to procure the appointment of naturalist to
      a Government Surveying Expedition. She had even jocularly proposed to
      dress herself in man's attire and &ldquo;enlist&rdquo; as his assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will be safe with your friends, I hope, by that time,&rdquo; responded
      Low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe with my friends,&rdquo; she repeated in a lower voice. &ldquo;Safe with my
      friends&mdash;yes!&rdquo; An awkward silence followed; Teresa broke it gayly:
      &ldquo;But your girl, your sweetheart, my benefactor&mdash;will SHE let you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't told her yet,&rdquo; said Low, gravely, &ldquo;but I don't see why she
      should object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Object, indeed!&rdquo; interrupted Teresa in a high voice and a sudden and
      utterly gratuitous indignation; &ldquo;how should she? I'd like to see her do
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She accompanied him some distance to the intersection of the trail, where
      they parted in good spirits. On the dusty plain without a gale was blowing
      that rocked the high tree-tops above her, but, tempered and subdued,
      entered the low aisles with a fluttering breath of morning and a sound
      like the cooing of doves. Never had the wood before shown so sweet a sense
      of security from the turmoil and tempest of the world beyond; never before
      had an intrusion from the outer life&mdash;even in the shape of a letter&mdash;seemed
      so wicked a desecration. Tempted by the solicitation of air and shade, she
      lingered, with Low's herbarium slung on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange sensation, like a shiver, suddenly passed across her nerves, and
      left them in a state of rigid tension. With every sense morbidly acute,
      with every faculty strained to its utmost, the subtle instincts of Low's
      woodcraft transformed and possessed her. She knew it now! A new element
      was in the wood&mdash;a strange being&mdash;another life&mdash;another man
      approaching! She did not even raise her head to look about her, but darted
      with the precision and fleetness of an arrow in the direction of her tree.
      But her feet were arrested, her limbs paralzyed, her very existence
      suspended, by the sound of a voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a voice that had rung in her ears for the last two years in all
      phases of intensity, passion, tenderness, and anger; a voice upon whose
      modulations, rude and unmusical though they were, her heart and soul had
      hung in transport or anguish. But it was a chime that had rung its last
      peal to her senses as she entered the Carquinez Woods, and for the last
      week had been as dead to her as a voice from the grave. It was the voice
      of her lover&mdash;Dick Curson!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      The wind was blowing towards the stranger, so that he was nearly upon her
      when Teresa first took the alarm. He was a man over six feet in height,
      strongly built, with a slight tendency to a roundness of bulk which
      suggested reserved rather than impeded energy. His thick beard and
      mustache were closely cropped around a small and handsome mouth that
      lisped except when he was excited, but always kept fellowship with his
      blue eyes in a perpetual smile of half-cynical good-humor. His dress was
      superior to that of the locality; his general expression that of a man of
      the world, albeit a world of San Francisco, Sacramento, and Murderer's
      Bar. He advanced towards her with a laugh and an outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU here!&rdquo; she gasped, drawing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently neither surprised nor mortified at this reception, he answered
      frankly, &ldquo;Yeth. You didn't expect me, I know. But Doloreth showed me the
      letter you wrote her, and&mdash;well&mdash;here I am, ready to help you,
      with two men and a thpare horthe waiting outside the woodth on the blind
      trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;YOU&mdash;here?&rdquo; she only repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curson shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Yeth. Of courth you never expected to thee
      me again, and leatht of all HERE. I'll admit that; I'll thay I wouldn't if
      I'd been in your plathe. I'll go further, and thay you didn't want to thee
      me again&mdash;anywhere. But it all cometh to the thame thing; here I am.
      I read the letter you wrote Doloreth. I read how you were hiding here,
      under Dunn'th very nothe, with his whole pothe out, cavorting round and
      barkin' up the wrong tree. I made up my mind to come down here with a few
      nathty friends of mine and cut you out under Dunn'th nothe, and run you
      over into Yuba&mdash;that'th all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dared she show you my letter&mdash;YOU of all men? How dared she ask
      YOUR help?&rdquo; continued Teresa, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she didn't athk my help,&rdquo; he responded coolly. &ldquo;D&mdash;d if I don't
      think she jutht calculated I'd be glad to know you were being hunted down
      and thtarving, that I might put Dunn on your track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; said Teresa, furiously; &ldquo;she was my friend. A better friend
      than those who professed&mdash;more,&rdquo; she added, with a contemptuous
      drawing away of her skirt as if she feared Curson's contamination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Thettle that with her when you go back,&rdquo; continued Curson
      philosophically. &ldquo;We can talk of that on the way. The thing now ith to get
      up and get out of thethe woods. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa's only reply was a gesture of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; continued Curson half soothingly, &ldquo;but they're
      waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them wait. I shall not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here&mdash;till the wolves eat me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teresa, listen. D&mdash;- it all&mdash;Teresa&mdash;Tita! see here,&rdquo; he
      said with sudden energy. &ldquo;I swear to God it's all right. I'm willing to
      let by-gones be by-gones and take a new deal. You shall come back as if
      nothing had happened, and take your old place as before. I don't mind
      doing the square thing, all round. If that's what you mean, if that's all
      that stands in the way, why, look upon the thing as settled. There, Tita,
      old girl, come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Careless or oblivious of her stony silence and starting eyes, he attempted
      to take her hand. But she disengaged herself with a quick movement, drew
      back, and suddenly crouched like a wild animal about to spring. Curson
      folded his arms as she leaped to her feet; the little dagger she had drawn
      from her garter flashed menacingly in the air, but she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man before her remained erect, impassive, and silent; the great trees
      around and beyond her remained erect, impassive, and silent; there was no
      sound in the dim aisles but the quick panting of her mad passion, no
      movement in the calm, motionless shadow but the trembling of her uplifted
      steel. Her arm bent and slowly sank, her fingers relaxed, the knife fell
      from her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'th quite enough for a thow,&rdquo; he said, with a return to his former
      cynical ease and a perceptible tone of relief in his voice. &ldquo;It'th the
      thame old Theretha. Well, then, if you won't go with me, go without me;
      take the led horthe and cut away. Dick Athley and Petereth will follow you
      over the county line. If you want thome money, there it ith.&rdquo; He took a
      buckskin purse from his pocket. &ldquo;If you won't take it from me&rdquo;&mdash;he
      hesitated as she made no reply&mdash;&ldquo;Athley'th flush and ready to lend
      you thome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not seemed to hear him, but had stooped in some embarrassment,
      picked up the knife and hastily hid it, then with averted face and nervous
      fingers was beginning to tear strips of loose bark from the nearest trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you thay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want any money, and I shall stay here.&rdquo; She hesitated, looked
      around her, and then added, with an effort, &ldquo;I suppose you meant well. Be
      it so! Let by-gones be by-gones. You said just now, 'It's the same old
      Teresa.' So she is, and seeing she's the same she's better here than
      anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was enough bitterness in her tone to call for Curson's
      half-perfunctory sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That be d&mdash;d,&rdquo; he responded quickly. &ldquo;Jutht thay you'll come, Tita,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped his half-spoken sentence with a negative gesture. &ldquo;You don't
      understand. I shall stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even if they don't theek you here, you can't live here forever. The
      friend that you wrote about who wath tho good to you, you know, can't keep
      you here alwayth; and are you thure you can alwayth trutht her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a woman; it's a man.&rdquo; She stopped short, and colored to the line
      of her forehead. &ldquo;Who said it was a woman?&rdquo; she continued fiercely, as if
      to cover her confusion with a burst of gratuitous anger. &ldquo;Is that another
      of your lies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Curson's lips, which for a moment had completely lost their smile, were
      now drawn together in a prolonged whistle. He gazed curiously at her gown,
      at her hat, at the bow of bright ribbon that tied her black hair, and
      said, &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poor man who has kept my secret,&rdquo; she went on hurriedly&mdash;&ldquo;a man as
      friendless and lonely as myself. Yes,&rdquo; disregarding Curson's cynical
      smile, &ldquo;a man who has shared everything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; suggested Curson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And turned himself out of his only shelter to give me a roof and
      covering,&rdquo; she continued mechanically, struggling with the new and
      horrible fancy that his words awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thlept every night at Indian Thpring to save your reputation,&rdquo; said
      Curson. &ldquo;Of courthe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa turned very white. Curson was prepared for an outburst of fury&mdash;perhaps
      even another attack. But the crushed and beaten woman only gazed at him
      with frightened and imploring eyes. &ldquo;For God's sake, Dick, don't say
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The amiable cynic was staggered. His good-humor and a certain chivalrous
      instinct he could not repress got the better of him. He shrugged his
      shoulders. &ldquo;What I thay, and what you DO, Teretha, needn't make us
      quarrel. I've no claim on you&mdash;I know it. Only&mdash;&rdquo; a vivid sense
      of the ridiculous, powerful in men of his stamp, completed her victory&mdash;&ldquo;only
      don't thay anything about my coming down here to cut you out from the&mdash;the&mdash;THE
      SHERIFF.&rdquo; He gave utterance to a short but unaffected laugh, made a slight
      grimace, and turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa did not join in his mirth. Awkward as it would have been if he had
      taken a severer view of the subject, she was mortified even amidst her
      fears and embarrassment at his levity. Just as she had become convinced
      that his jealousy had made her over-conscious, his apparent good-humored
      indifference gave that over-consciousness a guilty significance. Yet this
      was lost in her sudden alarm as her companion, looking up, uttered an
      exclamation, and placed his hand upon his revolver. With a sinking
      conviction that the climax had come, Teresa turned her eyes. From the dim
      aisles beyond, Low was approaching. The catastrophe seemed complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had barely time to utter an imploring whisper: &ldquo;In the name of God,
      not a word to him.&rdquo; But a change had already come over her companion. It
      was no longer a parley with a foolish woman; he had to deal with a man
      like himself. As Low's dark face and picturesque figure came nearer, Mr.
      Curson's proposed method of dealing with him was made audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ith it a mulatto or a Thircuth, or both?&rdquo; he asked, with affected
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low's Indian phlegm was impervious to such assault. He turned to Teresa,
      without apparently noticing her companion. &ldquo;I turned back,&rdquo; he said
      quietly, &ldquo;as soon as I knew there were strangers here; I thought you might
      need me.&rdquo; She noticed for the first time that, in addition to his rifle,
      he carried a revolver and hunting knife in his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeth,&rdquo; returned Curson, with an ineffectual attempt to imitate Low's
      phlegm; &ldquo;but ath I didn't happen to be a sthranger to this lady, perhaps
      it wathn't nethethary, particularly ath I had two friends&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting at the edge of the wood with a led horse,&rdquo; interrupted Low,
      without addressing him, but apparently continuing his explanation to
      Teresa. But she turned to Low with feverish anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so&mdash;he is an old friend&mdash;&rdquo; she gave a quick, imploring
      glance at Curson&mdash;&ldquo;an old friend who came to help me away&mdash;he is
      very kind,&rdquo; she stammered, turning alternately from the one to the other;
      &ldquo;but I told him there was no hurry&mdash;at least to-day&mdash;that you&mdash;were&mdash;very
      good&mdash;too, and would hide me a little longer, until your plan&mdash;you
      know YOUR plan,&rdquo; she added, with a look of beseeching significance to Low&mdash;&ldquo;could
      be tried.&rdquo; And then, with a helpless conviction that her excuses, motives,
      and emotions were equally and perfectly transparent to both men, she
      stopped in a tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhapth it 'th jutht ath well, then, that the gentleman came thtraight
      here, and didn't tackle my two friendth when he pathed them,&rdquo; observed
      Curson, half sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not passed your friends, nor have I been near them,&rdquo; said Low,
      looking at him for the first time, with the same exasperating calm, &ldquo;or
      perhaps I should not be HERE or they THERE. I knew that one man entered
      the wood a few moments ago, and that two men and four horses remained
      outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; said Teresa to Curson excitedly&mdash;&ldquo;that's true. He
      knows all. He can see without looking, hear without listening. He&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;
       she stammered, colored, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men had faced each other. Curson, after his first good-natured
      impulse, had retained no wish to regain Teresa, whom he felt he no longer
      loved, and yet who, for that very reason perhaps, had awakened his
      chivalrous instincts. Low, equally on his side, was altogether unconscious
      of any feeling which might grow into a passion, and prevent him from
      letting her go with another if for her own safety. They were both men of a
      certain taste and refinement. Yet, in spite of all this, some vague
      instinct of the baser male animal remained with them, and they were moved
      to a mutually aggressive attitude in the presence of the female.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word more, and the opening chapter of a sylvan Iliad might have begun.
      But this modern Helen saw it coming, and arrested it with an inspiration
      of feminine genius. Without being observed, she disengaged her knife from
      her bosom and let it fall as if by accident. It struck the ground with the
      point of its keen blade, bounded and rolled between them. The two men
      started and looked at each other with a foolish air. Curson laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon she can take care of herthelf,&rdquo; he said, extending his hand to
      Low. &ldquo;I'm off. But if I'm wanted SHE'LL know where to find me.&rdquo; Low took
      the proffered hand, but neither of the two men looked at Teresa. The
      reserve of antagonism once broken, a few words of caution, advice, and
      encouragement passed between them, in apparent obliviousness of her
      presence or her personal responsibility. As Curson at last nodded a
      farewell to her, Low insisted upon accompanying him as far as the horses,
      and in another moment she was again alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had saved a quarrel between them at the sacrifice of herself, for her
      vanity was still keen enough to feel that this exhibition of her old
      weakness had degraded her in their eyes, and, worse, had lost the respect
      her late restraint had won from Low. They had treated her like a child or
      a crazy woman, perhaps even now were exchanging criticisms upon her&mdash;perhaps
      pitying her! Yet she had prevented a quarrel, a fight; possibly the death
      of either one or the other of these men who despised her, for none better
      knew than she the trivial beginning and desperate end of these encounters.
      Would they&mdash;would Low ever realize it, and forgive her? Her small,
      dark hands went up to her eyes and she sank upon the ground. She looked
      through tear-veiled lashes upon the mute and giant witnesses of her deceit
      and passion, and tried to draw, from their immovable calm, strength and
      consolation as before. But even they seemed to stand apart, reserved and
      forbidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Low returned she hoped to gather from his eyes and manner what had
      passed between him and her former lover. But beyond a mere gentle
      abstraction at times he retained his usual calm. She was at last forced to
      allude to it herself with simulated recklessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I didn't get a very good character from my last place?&rdquo; she
      said, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; he replied, in evident sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lip and was silent. But as they were returning home, she said
      gently, &ldquo;I hope you were not angry with me for the lie I told when I spoke
      of 'your plan.' I could not give the real reason for not returning with&mdash;with&mdash;that
      man. But it's not all a lie. I have a plan&mdash;if you haven't. When you
      are ready to go to Sacramento to take your place, dress me as an Indian
      boy, paint my face, and let me go with you. You can leave me&mdash;there&mdash;you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not a bad idea,&rdquo; he responded gravely. &ldquo;We will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the next day, and the next, the rencontre seemed to be forgotten. The
      herbarium was already filled with rare specimens. Teresa had even overcome
      her feminine repugnance to &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; and creeping things so far as to assist
      in his entomological collection. He had drawn from a sacred cache in the
      hollow of a tree the few worn text-books from which he had studied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seem very precious,&rdquo; she said, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; he replied gravely. &ldquo;There was one with plates that the ants ate
      up, and it will be six months before I can afford to buy another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa glanced hurriedly over his well-worn buckskin suit, at his calico
      shirt with its pattern almost obliterated by countless washings, and
      became thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you couldn't buy one at Indian Spring?&rdquo; she said innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once Low was startled out of his phlegm. &ldquo;Indian Spring!&rdquo; he
      ejaculated; &ldquo;perhaps not even in San Francisco. These came from the
      States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get them?&rdquo; persisted Teresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought them for skins I got over the ridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean that&mdash;but no matter. Then you mean to sell that
      bearskin, don't you?&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low had, in fact, already sold it, the proceeds having been invested in a
      gold ring for Miss Nellie, which she scrupulously did not wear except in
      his presence. In his singular truthfulness he would have frankly confessed
      it to Teresa, but the secret was not his own. He contented himself with
      saying that he had disposed of it at Indian Spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa started, and communicated unconsciously some of her nervousness to
      her companion. They gazed in each other's eyes with a troubled expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it was wise to sell that particular skin, which might be
      identified?&rdquo; she asked timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low knitted his arched brows, but felt a strange sense of relief. &ldquo;Perhaps
      not,&rdquo; he said carelessly; &ldquo;but it's too late now to mend matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon she wrote several letters, and tore them up. One, however,
      she retained, and handed it to Low to post at Indian Spring, whither he
      was going. She called his attention to the superscription, being the same
      as the previous letter, and added, with affected gayety, &ldquo;But if the
      answer isn't as prompt, perhaps it will be pleasanter than the last.&rdquo; Her
      quick feminine eye noticed a little excitement in his manner and a more
      studious attention to his dress. Only a few days before she would not have
      allowed this to pass without some mischievous allusion to his mysterious
      sweetheart; it troubled her greatly now to find that she could not bring
      herself to this household pleasantry, and that her lip trembled and her
      eye grew moist as he parted from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon passed slowly; he had said he might not return to supper
      until late, nevertheless a strange restlessness took possession of her as
      the day wore on. She put aside her work, the darning of his stockings, and
      rambled aimlessly through the woods. She had wandered she knew not how
      far, when she was suddenly seized with the same vague sense of a foreign
      presence which she had felt before. Could it be Curson again, with a word
      of warning? No! she knew it was not he; so subtle had her sense become
      that she even fancied that she detected in the invisible aura projected by
      the unknown no significance or relation to herself or Low, and felt no
      fear. Nevertheless she deemed it wisest to seek the protection of her
      sylvan bower, and hurried swiftly thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not so quickly nor directly that she did not once or twice pause in
      her flight to examine the new-comer from behind a friendly trunk. He was a
      stranger&mdash;a young fellow with a brown mustache, wearing heavy Mexican
      spurs in his riding-boots, whose tinkling he apparently did not care to
      conceal. He had perceived her, and was evidently pursuing her, but so
      awkwardly and timidly that she eluded him with ease. When she had reached
      the security of the hollow tree and pulled the curtain of bark before the
      narrow opening, with her eye to the interstices, she waited his coming. He
      arrived breathlessly in the open space before the tree where the bear once
      lay; the dazed, bewildered, and half-awed expression of his face, as he
      glanced around him and through the openings of the forest aisles, brought
      a faint smile to her saddened face. At last he called in a
      half-embarrassed voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Nellie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile faded from Teresa's cheek. Who was &ldquo;Miss Nellie?&rdquo; She pressed
      her ear to the opening. &ldquo;Miss Wynn!&rdquo; the voice again called, but was lost
      in the echoless woods. Devoured with a new gratuitous curiosity, in
      another moment Teresa felt she would have disclosed herself at any risk,
      but the stranger rose and began to retrace his steps. Long after his
      tinkling spurs were lost in the distance, Teresa remained like a statue,
      staring at the place where he had stood. Then she suddenly turned like a
      mad woman, glanced down at the gown she was wearing, tore it from her back
      as if it had been a polluted garment, and stamped upon it in a convulsion
      of rage. And then, with her beautiful bare arms clasped together over her
      head, she threw herself upon her couch in a tempest of tears.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Miss Nellie reached the first mining extension of Indian Spring,
      which surrounded it like a fosse, she descended for one instant into one
      of its trenches, opened her parasol, removed her duster, hid it under a
      bowlder, and with a few shivers and cat-like strokes of her soft hands not
      only obliterated all material traces of the stolen cream of Carquinez
      Woods, but assumed a feline demureness quite inconsistent with any moral
      dereliction. Unfortunately, she forgot to remove at the same time a
      certain ring from her third finger, which she had put on with her duster
      and had worn at no other time. With this slight exception, the benignant
      fate which always protected that young person brought her in contact with
      the Burnham girls at one end of the main street as the returning coach to
      Excelsior entered the other, and enabled her to take leave of them before
      the coach office with a certain ostentation of parting which struck Mr.
      Jack Brace, who was lingering at the doorway, into a state of utter
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was Miss Nellie Wynn, the belle of Excelsior, calm, quiet,
      self-possessed, her chaste cambric skirts and dainty shoes as fresh as
      when she had left her father's house; but where was the woman of the brown
      duster, and where the yellow-dressed apparition of the woods? He was
      feebly repeating to himself his mental adjuration of a few hours before
      when he caught her eye, and was taken with a blush and a fit of coughing.
      Could he have been such an egregious fool, and was it not plainly written
      on his embarrassed face for her to read?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we going down together?&rdquo; asked Miss Nellie with an exceptionally
      gracious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was neither affectation nor coquetry in this advance. The girl had
      no idea of Brace's suspicion of her, nor did any uneasy desire to placate
      or deceive a possible rival of Low's prompt her graciousness. She simply
      wished to shake off in this encounter the already stale excitement of the
      past two hours, as she had shaken the dust of the woods from her clothes.
      It was characteristic of her irresponsible nature and transient
      susceptibilities that she actually enjoyed the relief of change; more than
      that, I fear, she looked upon this infidelity to a past dubious pleasure
      as a moral principle. A mild, open flirtation with a recognized man like
      Brace, after her secret passionate tryst with a nameless nomad like Low,
      was an ethical equipoise that seemed proper to one of her religious
      education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brace was only too happy to profit by Miss Nellie's condescension; he at
      once secured the seat by her side, and spent the four hours and a half of
      their return journey to Excelsior in blissful but timid communion with
      her. If he did not dare to confess his past suspicions, he was equally
      afraid to venture upon the boldness he had premeditated a few hours
      before. He was therefore obliged to take a middle course of slightly
      egotistical narration of his own personal adventures, with which he
      beguiled the young girl's ear. This he only departed from once, to
      describe to her a valuable grizzly bearskin which he had seen that day for
      sale at Indian Spring, with a view to divining her possible acceptance of
      it for a &ldquo;buggy robe;&rdquo; and once to comment upon a ring which she had
      inadvertently disclosed in pulling off her glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only an old family keepsake,&rdquo; she added, with easy mendacity; and
      affecting to recognize in Mr. Brace's curiosity a not unnatural excuse for
      toying with her charming fingers, she hid them in chaste and virginal
      seclusion in her lap, until she could recover the ring and resume her
      glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed&mdash;a week of peculiar and desiccating heat for even those
      dry Sierra table-lands. The long days were filled with impalpable dust and
      acrid haze suspended in the motionless air; the nights were breathless and
      dewless; the cold wind which usually swept down from the snow line was
      laid to sleep over a dark monotonous level, whose horizon was pricked with
      the eating fires of burning forest crests. The lagging coach of Indian
      Spring drove up at Excelsior, and precipitated its passengers with an
      accompanying cloud of dust before the Excelsior Hotel. As they emerged
      from the coach, Mr. Brace, standing in the doorway, closely scanned their
      begrimed and almost unrecognizable faces. They were the usual type of
      travelers: a single professional man in dusty black, a few traders in
      tweeds and flannels, a sprinkling of miners in red and gray shirts, a
      Chinaman, a negro, and a Mexican packer or muleteer. This latter for a
      moment mingled with the crowd in the bar-room, and even penetrated the
      corridor and dining-room of the hotel, as if impelled by a certain
      semi-civilized curiosity, and then strolled with a lazy, dragging step&mdash;half
      impeded by the enormous leather leggings, chains, and spurs, peculiar to
      his class&mdash;down the main street. The darkness was gathering, but the
      muleteer indulged in the same childish scrutiny of the dimly lighted
      shops, magazines, and saloons, and even of the occasional groups of
      citizens at the street corners. Apparently young, as far as the outlines
      of his figure could be seen, he seemed to show even more than the usual
      concern of masculine Excelsior in the charms of womankind. The few female
      figures about at that hour, or visible at window or veranda, received his
      marked attention; he respectfully followed the two auburn-haired daughters
      of Deacon Johnson on their way to choir meeting to the door of the church.
      Not content with that act of discreet gallantry, after they had entered he
      managed to slip unperceived behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The memorial of the Excelsior gamblers' generosity was a modern building,
      large and pretentious, for even Mr. Wynn's popularity, and had been
      good-humoredly known, in the characteristic language of the generous
      donors, as one of the &ldquo;biggest religious bluffs&rdquo; on record. Its groined
      rafters, which were so new and spicy that they still suggested their
      native forest aisles, seldom covered more than a hundred devotees, and in
      the rambling choir, with its bare space for the future organ, the few
      choristers, gathered round a small harmonium, were lost in the deepening
      shadow of that summer evening. The muleteer remained hidden in the
      obscurity of the vestibule. After a few moments' desultory conversation,
      in which it appeared that the unexpected absence of Miss Nellie Wynn,
      their leader, would prevent their practicing, the choristers withdrew. The
      stranger, who had listened eagerly, drew back in the darkness as they
      passed out, and remained for a few moments a vague and motionless figure
      in the silent church. Then coming cautiously to the window, the flapping
      broad-brimmed hat was put aside, and the faint light of the dying day
      shone in the black eyes of Teresa! Despite her face, darkened with dye and
      disfigured with dust, the matted hair piled and twisted around her head,
      the strange dress and boyish figure, one swift glance from under her
      raised lashes betrayed her identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned aside mechanically into the first pew, picked up and opened a
      hymn-book. Her eyes became riveted on a name written on the title-page,
      &ldquo;Nellie Wynn.&rdquo; HER name, and HER book. The instinct that had guided her
      here was right; the slight gossip of her fellow-passengers was right; this
      was the clergyman's daughter, whose praise filled all mouths. This was the
      unknown girl the stranger was seeking, but who in turn perhaps had been
      seeking Low&mdash;the girl who absorbed his fancy&mdash;the secret of his
      absences, his preoccupation, his coldness! This was the girl whom to see,
      perhaps in his arms, she was now periling her liberty and her life unknown
      to him! A slight odor, some faint perfume of its owner, came from the
      book; it was the same she had noticed in the dress Low had given her. She
      flung the volume to the ground, and, throwing her arms over the back of
      the pew before her, buried her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that light and attitude she might have seemed some rapt acolyte
      abandoned to self-communion. But whatever yearning her soul might have had
      for higher sympathy or deeper consolation, I fear that the spiritual
      Tabernacle of Excelsior and the Reverend Mr. Wynn did not meet that
      requirement. She only felt the dry, oven-like heat of that vast shell,
      empty of sentiment and beauty, hollow in its pretense and dreary in its
      desolation. She only saw in it a chief altar for the glorification of this
      girl who had absorbed even the pure worship of her companion, and
      converted and degraded his sublime paganism to her petty creed. With a
      woman's withering contempt for her own art displayed in another woman, she
      thought how she herself could have touched him with the peace that the
      majesty of their woodland aisles&mdash;so unlike this pillared sham&mdash;had
      taught her own passionate heart, had she but dared. Mingling with this
      imperfect theology, she felt she could have proved to him also that a
      brunette and a woman of her experience was better than an immature blonde.
      She began to loathe herself for coming hither, and dreaded to meet his
      face. Here a sudden thought struck her. What if he had not come here? What
      if she had been mistaken? What if her rash interpretation of his absence
      from the wood that night was simple madness? What if he should return&mdash;if
      he had already returned? She rose to her feet, whitening yet joyful with
      the thought. She could return at once; what was the girl to her now? Yet
      there was time to satisfy herself if he were at HER house. She had been
      told where it was; she could find it in the dark; an open door or window
      would betray some sign or sound of the occupants. She rose, replaced her
      hat over her eyes, knotted her flaunting scarf around her throat, groped
      her way to the door, and glided into the outer darkness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was quite dark when Mr. Jack Brace stopped before Father Wynn's open
      door. The windows were also invitingly open to the wayfarer, as were the
      pastoral counsels of Father Wynn, delivered to some favored guest within,
      in a tone of voice loud enough for a pulpit. Jack Brace paused. The
      visitor was the convalescent sheriff, Jim Dunn, who had publicly
      commemorated his recovery by making his first call upon the father of his
      inamorata. The Reverend Mr. Wynn had been expatiating upon the unremitting
      heat of a possible precursor of forest fires, and exhibiting some catholic
      knowledge of the designs of a Deity in that regard, and what should be the
      policy of the Legislature, when Mr. Brace concluded to enter. Mr. Wynn and
      the wounded man, who occupied an arm-chair by the window, were the only
      occupants of the room. But in spite of the former's ostentatious greeting,
      Brace could see that his visit was inopportune and unwelcome. The sheriff
      nodded a quick, impatient recognition, which, had it not been accompanied
      by an anathema on the heat, might have been taken as a personal insult.
      Neither spoke of Miss Nellie, although it was patent to Brace that they
      were momentarily expecting her. All of which went far to strengthen a
      certain wavering purpose in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha! strong language, Mr. Dunn,&rdquo; said Father Wynn, referring to the
      sheriff's adjuration, &ldquo;but 'out of the fullness of the heart the mouth
      speaketh.' Job, sir, cursed, we are told, and even expressed himself in
      vigorous Hebrew regarding his birthday. Ha, ha! I'm not opposed to that.
      When I have often wrestled with the spirit I confess I have sometimes
      said, 'D&mdash;n you.' Yes, sir, 'D&mdash;n you.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something so unutterably vile in the reverend gentleman's
      utterance and emphasis of this oath that the two men, albeit both easy and
      facile blasphemers, felt shocked; as the purest of actresses is apt to
      overdo the rakishness of a gay Lothario, Father Wynn's immaculate
      conception of an imprecation was something terrible. But he added, &ldquo;The
      law ought to interfere with the reckless use of camp-fires in the woods in
      such weather by packers and prospectors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't so much the work of white men,&rdquo; broke in Brace, &ldquo;as it is of
      Greasers, Chinamen, and Diggers, especially Diggers. There's that blasted
      Low, ranges the whole Carquinez Woods as if they were his. I reckon he
      ain't particular just where he throws his matches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's not a Digger; he's a Cherokee, and only a half-breed at that,&rdquo;
       interpolated Wynn. &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; he added, with the artful suggestion of the
      betrayed trust of a too credulous Christian, &ldquo;he deceived me in this as in
      other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In what other things Low had deceived him he did not say; but, to the
      astonishment of both men, Dunn growled a dissent to Brace's proposition.
      Either from some secret irritation with that possible rival, or impatience
      at the prolonged absence of Nellie, he had &ldquo;had enough of that sort of
      hog-wash ladled out to him for genuine liquor.&rdquo; As to the Carquinez Woods,
      he [Dunn] &ldquo;didn't know why Low hadn't as much right there as if he'd
      grabbed it under a preemption law and didn't live there.&rdquo; With this hint
      at certain speculations of Father Wynn in public lands for a homestead, he
      added that &ldquo;If they [Brace and Wynn] could bring him along any older
      American settler than an Indian, they might rake down his [Dunn's] pile.&rdquo;
       Unprepared for this turn in the conversation, Wynn hastened to explain
      that he did not refer to the pure aborigine, whose gradual extinction no
      one regretted more than himself, but to the mongrel, who inherited only
      the vices of civilization. &ldquo;There should be a law, sir, against the
      mingling of races. There are men, sir, who violate the laws of the Most
      High by living with Indian women&mdash;squaw men, sir, as they are
      called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dunn rose with a face livid with weakness and passion. &ldquo;Who dares say
      that? They are a d&mdash;d sight better than sneaking Northern
      Abolitionists, who married their daughters to buck niggers like&mdash;&rdquo;
       But a spasm of pain withheld this Parthian shot at the politics of his two
      companions, and he sank back helplessly in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      An awkward silence ensued. The three men looked at each other in
      embarrassment and confusion. Dunn felt that he had given way to a
      gratuitous passion; Wynn had a vague presentiment that he had said
      something that imperiled his daughter's prospects; and Brace was divided
      between an angry retort and the secret purpose already alluded to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all the blasted heat,&rdquo; said Dunn, with a forced smile, pushing away
      the whisky which Wynn had ostentatiously placed before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Wynn hastily; &ldquo;only it's a pity Nellie ain't here to
      give you her smelling-salts. She ought to be back now,&rdquo; he added, no
      longer mindful of Brace's presence; &ldquo;the coach is over-due now, though I
      reckon the heat made Yuba Bill take it easy at the up grade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean the coach from Indian Spring,&rdquo; said Brace quietly, &ldquo;it's in
      already; but Miss Nellie didn't come on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be she got out at the Crossing,&rdquo; said Wynn cheerfully; &ldquo;she sometimes
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't take the coach at Indian Spring,&rdquo; returned Brace, &ldquo;because I
      saw it leave, and passed it on Buckskin ten minutes ago, coming up the
      hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's stopped over at Burnham's,&rdquo; said Wynn reflectively. Then, in
      response to the significant silence of his guests, he added, in a tone of
      chagrin which his forced heartiness could not disguise, &ldquo;Well, boys, it's
      a disappointment all round; but we must take the lesson as it comes. I'll
      go over to the coach office and see if she's sent any word. Make
      yourselves at home until I return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the door had closed behind him, Brace arose and took his hat as if to
      go. With his hand on the lock, he turned to his rival, who, half hidden in
      the gathering darkness, still seemed unable to comprehend his ill-luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're waiting for that bald-headed fraud to come back with the truth
      about his daughter,&rdquo; said Brace coolly, &ldquo;you'd better send for your things
      and take up your lodgings here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Dunn sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that she's not at the Burnhams'; I mean that he either does or
      does not know WHERE she is, and that in either case he is not likely to
      give you information. But I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Carquinez Woods, in the arms of the man you were just defending&mdash;Low,
      the half-breed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The room had become so dark that from the road nothing could be
      distinguished. Only the momentary sound of struggling feet was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Brace's voice, &ldquo;and don't be a fool. You're too weak, and
      it ain't a fair fight. Let go your hold. I'm not lying&mdash;I wish to God
      I was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence, and Brace resumed, &ldquo;We've been rivals, I know. May be I
      thought my chance as good as yours. If what I say ain't truth, we'll stand
      as we stood before; and if you're on the shoot, I'm your man when you
      like, where you like, or on sight if you choose. But I can't bear to see
      another man played upon as I've been played upon&mdash;given dead away as
      I've been. It ain't on the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause, &ldquo;that's right, now steady. Listen. A
      week ago that girl went down just like this to Indian Spring. It was given
      out, like this, that she went to the Burnhams'. I don't mind saying, Dunn,
      that I went down myself, all on the square, thinking I might get a show to
      talk to her, just as YOU might have done, you know, if you had my chance.
      I didn't come across her anywhere. But two men that I met thought they
      recognized her in a disguise going into the woods. Not suspecting
      anything, I went after her; saw her at a distance in the middle of the
      woods in another dress that I can swear to, and was just coming up to her
      when she vanished&mdash;went like a squirrel up a tree, or down like a
      gopher in the ground, but vanished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said Dunn's voice. &ldquo;And just because you were a d&mdash;d
      fool, or had taken a little too much whisky, you thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady. That's just what I said to myself,&rdquo; interrupted Brace coolly,
      &ldquo;particularly when I saw her that same afternoon in another dress, saying
      'Good-by' to the Burnhams, as fresh as a rose and as cold as those
      snow-peaks. Only one thing&mdash;she had a ring on her finger she never
      wore before, and didn't expect me to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if she did? She might have bought it. I reckon she hasn't to consult
      you,&rdquo; broke in Dunn's voice sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't buy it,&rdquo; continued Brace quietly. &ldquo;Low gave that Jew trader a
      bearskin in exchange for it, and presented it to her. I found that out two
      days afterwards. I found out that out of the whole afternoon she spent
      less than an hour with the Burnhams. I found out that she bought a duster
      like the disguise the two men saw her in. I found the yellow dress she
      wore that day hanging up in Low's cabin&mdash;the place where I saw her go&mdash;THE
      RENDEZVOUS WHERE SHE MEETS HIM. Oh, you're listenin', are you? Stop! SIT
      DOWN!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I discovered it by accident,&rdquo; continued the voice of Brace when all was
      again quiet; &ldquo;it was hidden as only a squirrel or an Injin can hide when
      they improve upon nature. When I was satisfied that the girl had been in
      the woods, I was determined to find out where she vanished, and went there
      again. Prospecting around, I picked up at the foot of one of the biggest
      trees this yer old memorandum-book, with grasses and herbs stuck in it. I
      remembered that I'd heard old Wynn say that Low, like the d&mdash;d Digger
      that he was, collected these herbs; only he pretended it was for science.
      I reckoned the book was his and that he mightn't be far away. I lay low
      and waited. Bimeby I saw a lizard running down the root. When he got sight
      of me he stopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n the lizard! What's that got to do with where she is now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. That lizard had a piece of sugar in his mouth. Where did it
      come from? I made him drop it, and calculated he'd go back for more. He
      did. He scooted up that tree and slipped in under some hanging strips of
      bark. I shoved 'em aside, and found an opening to the hollow where they do
      their housekeeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn't see her there&mdash;and how do you know she is there now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I determined to make it sure. When she left to-day, I started an hour
      ahead of her, and hid myself at the edge of the woods. An hour after the
      coach arrived at Indian Spring, she came there in a brown duster and was
      joined by him. I'd have followed them, but the d&mdash;d hound has the
      ears of a squirrel, and though I was five hundred yards from him he was on
      his guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guard be blessed! Wasn't you armed? Why didn't you go for him?&rdquo; said
      Dunn, furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckoned I'd leave that for you,&rdquo; said Brace coolly. &ldquo;If he'd killed
      me, and if he'd even covered me with his rifle, he'd been sure to let
      daylight through me at double the distance. I shouldn't have been any
      better off, nor you either. If I'd killed HIM, it would have been your
      duty as sheriff to put me in jail; and I reckon it wouldn't have broken
      your heart, Jim Dunn, to have got rid of TWO rivals instead of one. Hullo!
      Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going?&rdquo; said Dunn hoarsely. &ldquo;Going to the Carquinez Woods, by God! to
      kill him before her. I'LL risk it, if you daren't. Let me succeed, and you
      can hang ME and take the girl yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sit down. Don't be a fool, Jim Dunn! You wouldn't keep the
      saddle a hundred yards. Did I say I wouldn't help you? No. If you're
      willing, we'll run the risk together, but it must be in my way. Hear me.
      I'll drive you down there in a buggy before daylight, and we'll surprise
      them in the cabin or as they leave the wood. But you must come as if to
      arrest him for some offense&mdash;say, as an escaped Digger from the
      Reservation, a dangerous tramp, a destroyer of public property in the
      forests, a suspected road agent, or anything to give you the right to hunt
      him. The exposure of him and Nellie, don't you see, must be accidental. If
      he resists, kill him on the spot, and nobody'll blame you; if he goes
      peaceably with you, and you once get him in Excelsior jail, when the story
      gets out that he's taken the belle of Excelsior for his squaw, if you'd
      the angels for your posse you couldn't keep the boys from hanging him to
      the first tree. What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the window, and looked out cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was the old man coming back and listening,&rdquo; he said, after a pause,
      &ldquo;it can't he helped. He'll hear it soon enough, if he don't suspect
      something already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look yer, Brace,&rdquo; broke in Dunn hoarsely. &ldquo;D&mdash;d if I understand you
      or you me. That dog Low has got to answer to ME, not to the LAW! I'll take
      my risk of killing him, on sight and on the square. I don't reckon to
      handicap myself with a warrant, and I am not going to draw him out with a
      lie. You hear me? That's me all the time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you calkilate to go down thar,&rdquo; said Brace contemptuously, &ldquo;yell out
      for him and Nellie, and let him line you on a rest from the first tree as
      if you were a grizzly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. &ldquo;What's that you were saying just now about a bearskin
      he sold?&rdquo; asked Dunn slowly, as if reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He exchanged a bearskin,&rdquo; replied Brace, &ldquo;with a single hole right over
      the heart. He's a dead shot, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n his shooting,&rdquo; said Dunn. &ldquo;I'm not thinking of that. How long
      ago did he bring in that bearskin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two weeks, I reckon. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing! Look yer, Brace, you mean well&mdash;thar's my hand. I'll go
      down with you there, but not as the sheriff. I'm going there as Jim Dunn,
      and you can come along as a white man, to see things fixed on the square.
      Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brace hesitated. &ldquo;You'll think better of my plan before you get there; but
      I've said I'd stand by you, and I will. Come, then. There's no time to
      lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed out into the darkness together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo; said Dunn impatiently, as Brace, who was
      supporting him by the arm, suddenly halted at the corner of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one was listening&mdash;did you not see him? Was it the old man?&rdquo;
       asked Brace hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast the old man! It was only one of them Mexican packers chock-full of
      whisky, and trying to hold up the house. What are you thinking of? We
      shall be late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his weakness, the wounded man hurriedly urged Brace forward,
      until they reached the latter's lodgings. To his surprise, the horse and
      buggy were already before the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you reckoned to go, any way?&rdquo; said Dunn, with a searching look at
      his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I calkilated SOMEBODY would go,&rdquo; returned Brace, evasively, patting the
      impatient Buckskin; &ldquo;but come in and take a drink before we leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dunn started out of a momentary abstraction, put his hand on his hip, and
      mechanically entered the house. They had scarcely raised the glasses to
      their lips when a sudden rattle of wheels was heard in the street. Brace
      set down his glass and ran to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the mare bolted,&rdquo; he said, with an oath. &ldquo;We've kept her too long
      standing. Follow me,&rdquo; and he dashed down the staircase into the street.
      Dunn followed with difficulty; when he reached the door he was already
      confronted by his breathless companion. &ldquo;She's gone off on a run, and I'll
      swear there was a man in the buggy!&rdquo; He stopped and examined the
      halter-strap, still fastened to the fence. &ldquo;Cut! by God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dunn turned pale with passion. &ldquo;Who's got another horse and buggy?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The new blacksmith in Main Street; but we won't get it by borrowing,&rdquo;
       said Brace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How then?&rdquo; asked Dunn savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seize it, as the sheriff of Yuba and his deputy, pursuing a confederate
      of the Injin Low&mdash;THE HORSE THIEF!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The brief hour of darkness that preceded the dawn was that night
      intensified by a dense smoke, which, after blotting out horizon and sky,
      dropped a thick veil on the high road and the silent streets of Indian
      Spring. As the buggy containing Sheriff Dunn and Brace dashed through the
      obscurity, Brace suddenly turned to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men bent forward over the dashboard. Above the steady plunging of
      their own horse-hoofs they could hear the quicker irregular beat of other
      hoofs in the darkness before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that horse thief!&rdquo; said Dunn, in a savage whisper. &ldquo;Bear to the
      right, and hand me the whip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dozen cuts of the cruel lash, and their maddened horse, bounding at each
      stroke, broke into a wild canter. The frail vehicle swayed from side to
      side at each spring of the elastic shafts. Steadying himself by one hand
      on the low rail, Dunn drew his revolver with the other. &ldquo;Sing out to him
      to pull up, or we'll fire. My voice is clean gone,&rdquo; he added, in a husky
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were so near that they could distinguish the bulk of a vehicle
      careering from side to side in the blackness ahead. Dunn deliberately
      raised his weapon. &ldquo;Sing out!&rdquo; he repeated impatiently. But Brace, who was
      still keeping in the shadow, suddenly grasped his companion's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! It's NOT Buckskin,&rdquo; he whispered hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DON'T YOU SEE WE'RE GAINING ON HIM?&rdquo; replied the other contemptuously.
      Dunn grasped his companion's hand and pressed it silently. Even in that
      supreme moment this horseman's tribute to the fugitive Buckskin
      forestalled all baser considerations of pursuit and capture!
    </p>
    <p>
      In twenty seconds they were abreast of the stranger, crowding his horse
      and buggy nearly into the ditch; Brace keenly watchful, Dunn suppressed
      and pale. In half a minute they were leading him a length; and when their
      horse again settled down to his steady work, the stranger was already lost
      in the circling dust that followed them. But the victors seemed
      disappointed. The obscurity had completely hidden all but the vague
      outlines of the mysterious driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not our game, anyway,&rdquo; whispered Dunn. &ldquo;Drive on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it was some friend of his,&rdquo; suggested Brace uneasily, &ldquo;what would
      you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I SAID I'd do,&rdquo; responded Dunn savagely. &ldquo;I don't want five minutes
      to do it in, either; we'll be half an hour ahead of that d&mdash;d fool,
      whoever he is. Look here; all you've got to do is to put me in the trail
      to that cabin. Stand back of me, out of gun-shot, alone, if you like, as
      my deputy, or with any number you can pick up as my posse. If he gets by
      me as Nellie's lover, you may shoot him or take him as a horse thief, if
      you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you won't shoot him on sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till I've had a word with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've chirped,&rdquo; said the sheriff gravely. &ldquo;Drive on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments only the plunging hoofs and rattling wheels were heard.
      A dull, lurid glow began to define the horizon. They were silent until an
      abatement of the smoke, the vanishing of the gloomy horizon line, and a
      certain impenetrability in the darkness ahead showed them they were
      nearing the Carquinez Woods. But they were surprised on entering them to
      find the dim aisles alight with a faint mystic Aurora. The tops of the
      towering spires above them had caught the gleam of the distant forest
      fires, and reflected it as from a gilded dome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be hot work if the Carquinez Woods should conclude to take a
      hand in this yer little game that's going on over on the Divide yonder,&rdquo;
       said Brace, securing his horse and glancing at the spires overhead. &ldquo;I
      reckon I'd rather take a back seat at Injin Spring when the show
      commences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dunn did not reply, but, buttoning his coat, placed one hand on his
      companion's shoulder, and sullenly bade him &ldquo;lead the way.&rdquo; Advancing
      slowly and with difficulty the desperate man might have been taken for a
      peaceful invalid returning from an early morning stroll. His right hand
      was buried thoughtfully in the side pocket of his coat. Only Brace knew
      that it rested on the handle of his pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time the latter stopped and consulted the faint trail with a
      minuteness that showed recent careful study. Suddenly he paused. &ldquo;I made a
      blaze hereabouts to show where to leave the trail. There it is,&rdquo; he added,
      pointing to a slight notch cut in the trunk of an adjoining tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we've just passed one,&rdquo; said Dunn, &ldquo;if that's what you are looking
      after, a hundred yards back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brace uttered an oath, and ran back in the direction signified by his
      companion. Presently he returned with a smile of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've suspected something. It's a clever trick, but it won't hold
      water. That blaze which was done to muddle you was cut with an axe; this
      which I made was done with a bowie-knife. It's the real one. We're not far
      off now. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded cautiously, at right angles with the &ldquo;blazed&rdquo; tree, for ten
      minutes more. The heat was oppressive; drops of perspiration rolled from
      the forehead of the sheriff, and at times, when he attempted to steady his
      uncertain limbs, his hands shrank from the heated, blistering bark he
      touched with ungloved palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Brace, pausing at last. &ldquo;Do you see that biggest tree,
      with the root stretching out halfway across to the opposite one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's further to the right and abreast of the dead brush,&rdquo; interrupted
      Dunn quickly, with a sudden revelation that this was the spot where he had
      found the dead bear in the night Teresa escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; responded Brace, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the opening is on the other side, opposite the dead brush,&rdquo; said
      Dunn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know it?&rdquo; said Brace suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon!&rdquo; responded Dunn, grimly. &ldquo;That's enough! Fall back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the surprise of his companion, he lifted his head erect, and with a
      strong, firm step walked directly to the tree. Reaching it, he planted
      himself squarely before the opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply. A squirrel scampered away close to his feet. Brace,
      far in the distance, after an ineffectual attempt to distinguish his
      companion through the intervening trunks, took off his coat, leaned
      against a tree, and lit a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out of that cabin!&rdquo; continued Dunn, in a clear, resonant voice.
      &ldquo;Come out before I drag you out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, 'Captain Scott.' Don't shoot, and I'll come down,&rdquo; said a
      voice as clear and as high as his own. The hanging strips of bark were
      dashed aside, and a woman leaped lightly to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dunn staggered back. &ldquo;Teresa! by the Eternal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Teresa! the old Teresa! Teresa, a hundred times more vicious,
      reckless, hysterical, extravagant, and outrageous than before. Teresa,
      staring with tooth and eye, sunburnt and embrowned, her hair hanging down
      her shoulders, and her shawl drawn tightly around her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teresa it is! the same old gal! Here we are again! Return of the favorite
      in her original character! For two weeks only! Houp la! Tshk!&rdquo; and,
      catching her yellow skirt with her fingers, she pirouetted before the
      astounded man, and ended in a pose. Recovering himself with an effort,
      Dunn dashed forward and seized her by the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me, woman! Is that Low's cabin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who occupies it besides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Teresa slowly, with an extravagant affectation of modesty,
      &ldquo;nobody else but us, I reckon. Two's company, you know, and three's none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! Will you swear that there isn't a young girl, his&mdash;his
      sweetheart&mdash;concealed there with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fire in Teresa's eye was genuine as she answered steadily, &ldquo;Well, it
      ain't my style to put up with that sort of thing; at least, it wasn't over
      at Yolo, and you know it, Jim Dunn, or I wouldn't be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Dunn hurriedly. &ldquo;But I'm a d&mdash;d fool, or worse, the
      fool of a fool. Tell me, Teresa, is this man Low your lover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Teresa lowered her eyes as if in maidenly confusion. &ldquo;Well, if I'd known
      that YOU had any feeling of your own about it&mdash;if you'd spoken sooner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me, you devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has been with you here&mdash;yesterday&mdash;to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; He laughed a weak, foolish laugh, and, turning pale, suddenly
      lapsed against a tree. He would have fallen, but with a quick instinct
      Teresa sprang to his side, and supported him gently to a root. The action
      over, they both looked astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that wasn't much like either you or me,&rdquo; said Dunn slowly, &ldquo;was
      it? But if you'd let me drop then you'd have stretched out the biggest
      fool in the Sierras.&rdquo; He paused, and looked at her curiously. &ldquo;What's come
      over you; blessed if I seem to know you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was very pale again, and quiet; that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teresa! d&mdash;n it, look here! When I was laid up yonder in Excelsior I
      said I wanted to get well for only two things. One was to hunt you down,
      the other to marry Nellie Wynn. When I came here I thought that last thing
      could never be. I came here expecting to find her here with Low, and kill
      him&mdash;perhaps kill her too. I never once thought of you; not once. You
      might have risen up before me&mdash;between me and him&mdash;and I'd have
      passed you by. And now that I find it's all a mistake, and it was you, not
      her, I was looking for, why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she interrupted bitterly, &ldquo;you'll just take me, of course, to save
      your time and earn your salary. I'm ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'M not, just yet,&rdquo; he said faintly. &ldquo;Help me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She mechanically assisted him to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now stand where you are,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and don't move beyond this tree till
      I return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He straightened himself with an effort, clenched his fists until the nails
      were nearly buried in his palms, and strode with a firm, steady step in
      the direction he had come. In a few moments he returned and stood before
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've sent away my deputy&mdash;the man who brought me here, the fool who
      thought you were Nellie. He knows now he made a mistake. But who it was he
      mistook for Nellie he does not know, nor shall ever know, nor shall any
      living being know, other than myself. And when I leave the wood to-day I
      shall know it no longer. You are safe here as far as I am concerned, but I
      cannot screen you from others prying. Let Low take you away from here as
      soon as he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him take me away? Ah, yes. For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save you,&rdquo; said Dunn. &ldquo;Look here, Teresa! Without knowing it, you
      lifted me out of hell just now, and because of the wrong I might have done
      her&mdash;for HER sake, I spare you and shirk my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For her sake!&rdquo; gasped the woman&mdash;&ldquo;for her sake! Oh, yes! Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dunn gloomily, &ldquo;I reckon perhaps you'd as lieve left me in
      hell, for all the love you bear me. And may be you've grudge enough agin
      me still to wish I'd found her and him together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; she said, turning her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, d&mdash;n it! I didn't mean to make you cry. May be you wouldn't,
      then. Only tell that fellow to take you out of this, and not run away the
      next time he sees a man coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't run,&rdquo; said Teresa, with flashing eyes. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I sent
      him away,&rdquo; she stammered. Then, suddenly turning with fury upon him, she
      broke out, &ldquo;Run! Run from you! Ha, ha! You said just now I'd a grudge
      against you. Well, listen, Jim Dunn. I'd only to bring you in range of
      that young man's rifle, and you'd have dropped in your tracks like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like that bar, the other night,&rdquo; said Dunn, with a short laugh. &ldquo;So THAT
      was your little game?&rdquo; He checked his laugh suddenly&mdash;a cloud passed
      over his face. &ldquo;Look here, Teresa,&rdquo; he said, with an assumption of
      carelessness that was as transparent as it was utterly incompatible with
      his frank, open selfishness. &ldquo;What became of that bar? The skin&mdash;eh?
      That was worth something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Teresa quietly. &ldquo;Low exchanged it and got a ring for me from
      that trader Isaacs. It was worth more, you bet. And the ring didn't fit
      either&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interrupted Dunn, with an almost childish eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I made him take it back, and get the value in money. I hear that
      Isaacs sold it again and made another profit; but that's like those
      traders.&rdquo; The disingenuous candor of Teresa's manner was in exquisite
      contrast to Dunn. He rose and grasped her hand so heartily she was forced
      to turn her eyes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look tired,&rdquo; she murmured, with a sudden gentleness that surprised
      him; &ldquo;let me go with you a part of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't safe for you just now,&rdquo; he said, thinking of the possible
      consequences of the alarm Brace had raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the way YOU came,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but one known only to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated only a moment. &ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;let us go
      at once. It's suffocating here, and I seem to feel this dead bark crinkle
      under my feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She cast a rapid glance around her, and then seemed to sound with her eyes
      the far-off depths of the aisles, beginning to grow pale with the
      advancing day, but still holding a strange quiver of heat in the air. When
      she had finished her half-abstracted scrutiny of the distance, she cast
      one backward glance at her own cabin and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you wait a moment for me?&rdquo; she asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but&mdash;no tricks, Teresa! It isn't worth the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked him squarely in the eyes without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was absent for some moments. He was beginning to become uneasy, when
      she made her appearance again, clad in her old faded black dress. Her face
      was very pale, and her eyes were swollen, but she placed his hand on her
      shoulder, and bidding him not to fear to lean upon her, for she was quite
      strong, led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look more like yourself now, and yet&mdash;blast it all!&mdash;you
      don't either,&rdquo; said Dunn, looking down upon her. &ldquo;You've changed in some
      way. What is it? Is it on account of that Injin? Couldn't you have found a
      white man in his place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he's neither worse nor better for that,&rdquo; she replied bitterly;
      &ldquo;and perhaps he wasn't as particular in his taste as a white man might
      have been. But,&rdquo; she added, with a sudden spasm of her old rage, &ldquo;it's a
      lie; he's NOT an Indian, no more than I am. Not unless being born of a
      mother who scarcely knew him, of a father who never even saw him, and
      being brought up among white men and wild beasts&mdash;less cruel than
      they were&mdash;could make him one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dunn looked at her in surprise not unmixed with admiration. &ldquo;If Nellie,&rdquo;
       he thought, &ldquo;could but love ME like that!&rdquo; But he only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all that, he's an Injin. Why, look at his name. It ain't Low. It's
      L'Eau Dormante, Sleeping Water, an Injin name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does that prove?&rdquo; returned Teresa. &ldquo;Only that Indians clap a
      nick-name on any stranger, white or red, who may camp with them. Why, even
      his own father, a white man, the wretch who begot him and abandoned him,&mdash;HE
      had an Indian name&mdash;Loup Noir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le Loup Noir, the Black Wolf. I suppose you'd call him an Indian, too?
      Eh! What's the matter? We're walking too fast. Stop a moment and rest.
      There&mdash;there, lean on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was none too soon; for, after holding him upright a moment, his limbs
      failed, and stooping gently she was obliged to support him half reclining
      against a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its the heat!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Give me some whisky from my flask. Never mind
      the water,&rdquo; he added faintly, with a forced laugh, after he had taken a
      draught at the strong spirit. &ldquo;Tell me more about the other water&mdash;the
      Sleeping Water&mdash;you know. How do you know all this about him and his&mdash;father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly from him and partly from Curson, who wrote to me about him,&rdquo; she
      answered with some hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dunn did not seem to notice this incongruity of correspondence with a
      former lover. &ldquo;And HE told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I saw the name on an old memorandum book he has, which he says
      belonged to his father. It's full of old accounts of some trading post on
      the frontier. It's been missing for a day or two, but it will turn up. But
      I can swear I saw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dunn attempted to rise to his feet. &ldquo;Put your hand in my pocket,&rdquo; he said
      in a hurried whisper. &ldquo;No, there!&mdash;bring out a book. There, I haven't
      looked at it yet. Is that it?&rdquo; he added, handing her the book Brace had
      given him a few hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Teresa, in surprise. &ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind! Now let me see it, quick. Open it, for my sight is failing.
      There&mdash;thank you&mdash;that's all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take more whisky,&rdquo; said Teresa, with a strange anxiety creeping over her.
      &ldquo;You are faint again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! Listen, Teresa&mdash;lower&mdash;put your ear lower. Listen! I came
      near killing that chap Low to-day. Wouldn't it have been ridiculous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to smile, but his head fell back. He had fainted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the first time in her life Teresa lost her presence of mind in an
      emergency. She could only sit staring at the helpless man, scarcely
      conscious of his condition, her mind filled with a sudden prophetic
      intuition of the significance of his last words. In the light of that new
      revelation she looked into his pale, haggard face for some resemblance to
      Low, but in vain. Yet her swift feminine instinct met the objection. &ldquo;It's
      the mother's blood that would show,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;not this man's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Recovering herself, she began to chafe his hands and temples, and
      moistened his lips with the spirit. When his respiration returned with a
      faint color to his cheeks, she pressed his hands eagerly and leaned over
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; he whispered faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Low is really your son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said so?&rdquo; he asked, opening his round eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did yourself, a moment ago,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;Don't you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did. Is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled faintly. &ldquo;I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held her breath in expectation. But only the ludicrousness of the
      discovery seemed paramount to his weakened faculties. &ldquo;Isn't it just about
      the ridiculousest thing all round?&rdquo; he said, with a feeble chuckle. &ldquo;First
      YOU nearly kill me before you know I am Low's father; then I'm just
      spoilin' to kill him before I know he's my son; then that god-forsaken
      fool Jack Brace mistakes you for Nellie and Nellie for you. Ain't it just
      the biggest thing for the boys to get hold of? But we must keep it dark
      until after I marry Nellie, don't you see? Then we'll have a good time all
      round, and I'll stand the drinks. Think of it, Teresha! You don' no me, I
      do' no you, nobody knowsh anybody elsh. I try kill Lo'. Lo' wants kill
      Nellie. No thath no ri&mdash;'&rdquo; but the potent liquor, overtaking his
      exhausted senses, thickened, impeded, and at last stopped his speech. His
      head slipped to her shoulder, and he became once more unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa breathed again. In that brief moment she had abandoned herself to a
      wild inspiration of hope which she could scarcely define. Not that it was
      entirely a wild inspiration; she tried to reason calmly. What if she
      revealed the truth to him? What if she told the wretched man before her
      that she had deceived him; that she had overheard his conversation with
      Brace; that she had stolen Brace's horse to bring Low warning; that,
      failing to find Low in his accustomed haunts, or at the campfire, she had
      left a note for him pinned to the herbarium, imploring him to fly with his
      companion from the danger that was coming; and that, remaining on watch,
      she had seen them both&mdash;Brace and Dunn&mdash;approaching, and had
      prepared to meet them at the cabin? Would this miserable and maddened man
      understand her self-abnegation? Would he forgive Low and Nellie?&mdash;she
      did not ask for herself. Or would the revelation turn his brain, if it did
      not kill him outright? She looked at the sunken orbits of his eyes and
      hectic on his cheek, and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was this added to the agony she already suffered? She had been willing
      to stand between them with her life, her liberty, and even&mdash;the hot
      blood dyed her cheek at the thought&mdash;with the added shame of being
      thought the cast-off mistress of that man's son. Yet all this she had
      taken upon herself in expiation of something&mdash;she knew not clearly
      what; no, for nothing&mdash;only for HIM. And yet this very situation
      offered her that gleam of hope which had thrilled her; a hope so wild in
      its improbability, so degrading in its possibility, that at first she knew
      not whether despair was not preferable to its shame. And yet was it
      unreasonable? She was no longer passionate; she would be calm and think it
      out fairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would go to Low at once. She would find him somewhere&mdash;and even
      if with that girl, what mattered?&mdash;and she would tell him all. When
      he knew that the life and death of his father lay in the scale, would he
      let his brief, foolish passion for Nellie stand in the way? Even if he
      were not influenced by filial affection or mere compassion, would his
      pride let him stoop to a rivalry with the man who had deserted his youth?
      Could he take Dunn's promised bride, who must have coquetted with him to
      have brought him to this miserable plight? Was this like the calm, proud
      young god she knew? Yet she had an uneasy instinct that calm, proud young
      gods and goddesses did things like this, and felt the weakness of her
      reasoning flush her own conscious cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teresa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started. Dunn was awake, and was gazing at her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was reckoning it was the only square thing for Low to stop this
      promiscuous picnicking here and marry you out and out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry me!&rdquo; said Teresa in a voice that, with all her efforts, she could
      not make cynical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;after I've married Nellie; tote you down to San
      Angeles, and there take my name like a man, and give it to you. Nobody'll
      ask after TERESA, sure&mdash;you bet your life. And if they do, and he
      can't stop their jaw, just you call on the old man. It's mighty queer,
      ain't it, Teresa, to think of your being my daughter-in-law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed here as if he was about to lapse again into unconsciousness over
      the purely ludicrous aspect of the subject, but he haply recovered his
      seriousness. &ldquo;He'll have as much money from me as he wants to go into
      business with. What's his line of business, Teresa?&rdquo; asked this
      prospective father-in-law, in a large, liberal way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a botanist!&rdquo; said Teresa, with a sudden childish animation that
      seemed to keep up the grim humor of the paternal suggestion; &ldquo;and oh, he
      is too poor to buy books! I sent for one or two for him myself, the other
      day&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;it was all the money I had, but it wasn't
      enough for him to go on with his studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dunn looked at her sparkling eyes and glowing cheeks, and became
      thoughtful. &ldquo;Curson must have been a d&mdash;d fool,&rdquo; he said finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresa remained silent. She was beginning to be impatient and uneasy,
      fearing some mischance that might delay her dreaded, yet longed-for
      meeting with Low. Yet she could not leave this sick and exhausted man, HIS
      FATHER, now bound to her by more than mere humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't you manage,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;to lean on me a few steps
      further, until I could bring you to a cooler spot and nearer assistance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. She lifted him almost like a child to his feet. A spasm of pain
      passed over his face. &ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than ten minutes,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make a spurt for that time,&rdquo; he said coolly, and began to walk
      slowly but steadily on. Only his face, which was white and set, and the
      convulsive grip of his hand on her arm betrayed the effort. At the end of
      ten minutes she stopped. They stood before the splintered,
      lightning-scarred shaft in the opening of the woods, where Low had built
      her first camp-fire. She carefully picked up the herbarium, but her quick
      eye had already detected in the distance, before she had allowed Dunn to
      enter the opening with her, that her note was gone. Low had been there
      before them; he had been warned, as his absence from the cabin showed; he
      would not return there. They were free from interruption&mdash;but where
      had he gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick man drew a long breath of relief as she seated him in the
      clover-grown hollow where she had slept the second night of her stay.
      &ldquo;It's cooler than those cursed woods,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose it's because
      it's a little like a grave. What are you going to do now?&rdquo; he added, as
      she brought a cup of water and placed it at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to leave you here for a little while,&rdquo; she said cheerfully,
      but with a pale face and nervous hands. &ldquo;I'm going to leave you while I
      seek Low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sick man raised his head. &ldquo;I'm good for a spurt, Teresa, like that
      I've just got through, but I don't think I'm up to a family party.
      Couldn't you issue cards later on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'm going to get Low to send some one
      of your friends to you here. I don't think he'll begrudge leaving HER a
      moment for that,&rdquo; she added to herself bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that you're saying?&rdquo; he queried, with the nervous quickness of an
      invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;but that I'm going now.&rdquo; She turned her face aside to hide
      her moistened eyes. &ldquo;Wish me good luck, won't you?&rdquo; she asked, half sadly,
      half pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came and bent over him. He suddenly raised his hands, and, drawing her
      face down to his own, kissed her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give that to HIM,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;from ME.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and fled, happily for her sentiment, not hearing the feeble
      laugh that followed, as Dunn, in sheer imbecility, again referred to the
      extravagant ludicrousness of the situation. &ldquo;It is about the biggest thing
      in the way of a sell all round,&rdquo; he repeated, lying on his back,
      confidentially to the speck of smoke-obscured sky above him. He pictured
      himself repeating it, not to Nellie&mdash;her severe propriety might at
      last overlook the fact, but would not tolerate the joke&mdash;but to her
      father! It would be one of those characteristic Californian jokes Father
      Wynn would admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his exhaustion fever presently succeeded, and he began to grow
      restless. The heat too seemed to invade his retreat, and from time to time
      the little patch of blue sky was totally obscured by clouds of smoke. He
      amused himself with watching a lizard who was investigating a folded piece
      of paper, whose elasticity gave the little creature lively apprehensions
      of its vitality. At last he could stand the stillness of his retreat and
      his supine position no longer, and rolled himself out of the bed of leaves
      that Teresa had so carefully prepared for him. He rose to his feet stiff
      and sore, and, supporting himself by the nearest tree, moved a few steps
      from the dead ashes of the camp-fire. The movement frightened the lizard,
      who abandoned the paper and fled. With a satirical recollection of Brace
      and his &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; discovery through the medium of this animal, he
      stooped and picked up the paper. &ldquo;Like as not,&rdquo; he said to himself, with
      grim irony, &ldquo;these yer lizards are in the discovery business. P'r'aps this
      may lead to another mystery,&rdquo; and he began to unfold the paper with a
      smile. But the smile ceased as his eye suddenly caught his own name.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen lines were written in pencil on what seemed to be a blank leaf
      originally torn from some book. He trembled so that he was obliged to sit
      down to read these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you get this keep away from the woods. Dunn and another man are in
      deadly pursuit of you and your companion. I overheard their plan to
      surprise you in our cabin. DON'T GO THERE, and I will delay them and put
      them off the scent. Don't mind me. God bless you, and if you never see me
      again think sometimes of
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TERESA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His trembling ceased; he did not start, but rose in an abstracted way, and
      made a few deliberate steps in the direction Teresa had gone. Even then he
      was so confused that he was obliged to refer to the paper again, but with
      so little effect that he could only repeat the last words, &ldquo;think
      sometimes of Teresa.&rdquo; He was conscious that this was not all; he had a
      full conviction of being deceived, and knew that he held the proof in his
      hand, but he could not formulate it beyond that sentence. &ldquo;Teresa&rdquo;&mdash;yes,
      he would think of her. She would explain it. And here she was returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that brief interval her face and manner had again changed. Her face was
      pale and quite breathless. She cast a swift glance at Dunn and the paper
      he mechanically held out, walked up to him, and tore it from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said hoarsely, &ldquo;what are you going to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He attempted to speak, but his voice failed him. Even then he was
      conscious that if he had spoken he would have only repeated, &ldquo;think
      sometimes of Teresa.&rdquo; He looked longingly but helplessly at the spot where
      she had thrown the paper, as if it had contained his unuttered words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on to herself, as if he was a mute, indifferent spectator&mdash;&ldquo;yes,
      they're gone. That ends it all. The game's played out. Well!&rdquo; suddenly
      turning upon him, &ldquo;now you know it all. Your Nellie WAS here with him, and
      is with him now. Do you hear? Make the most of it; you've lost them&mdash;but
      here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said eagerly&mdash;&ldquo;yes, Teresa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, stared at him; then taking him by the hand led him like a
      child back to his couch. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, in half-savage explanation, &ldquo;I
      told you the truth when I said the girl wasn't at the cabin last night,
      and that I didn't know her. What are you glowerin' at? No! I haven't lied
      to you, I swear to God, except in one thing. Did you know what that was?
      To save him I took upon me a shame I don't deserve. I let you think I was
      his mistress. You think so now, don't you? Well, before God to-day&mdash;and
      He may take me when He likes&mdash;I'm no more to him than a sister! I
      reckon your Nellie can't say as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, and with the quick, impatient stride of some caged animal
      made the narrow circuit of the opening, stopping a moment mechanically
      before the sick man, and again, without looking at him, continuing her
      monotonous round. The heat had become excessive, but she held her shawl
      with both hands drawn tightly over her shoulders. Suddenly a wood-duck
      darted out of the covert blindly into the opening, struck against the
      blasted trunk, fell half stunned near her feet, and then, recovering,
      fluttered away. She had scarcely completed another circuit before the
      irruption was followed by a whirring bevy of quail, a flight of jays, and
      a sudden tumult of wings swept through the wood like a tornado. She turned
      inquiringly to Dunn, who had risen to his feet, but the next moment she
      caught convulsively at his wrist; a wolf had just dashed through the
      underbrush not a dozen yards away, and on either side of them they could
      hear the scamper and rustle of hurrying feet like the outburst of a summer
      shower. A cold wind arose from the opposite direction, as if to contest
      this wild exodus, but it was followed by a blast of sickening heat. Teresa
      sank at Dunn's feet in an agony of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let them touch me!&rdquo; she gasped; &ldquo;keep them off! Tell me, for God's
      sake, what has happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand firmly on her arm, and lifted her in his turn to her feet
      like a child. In that supreme moment of physical danger, his strength,
      reason, and manhood returned in their plenitude of power. He pointed
      coolly to the trail she had quitted, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Carquinez Woods are on fire!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      The nest of the tuneful Burnhams, although in the suburbs of Indian
      Spring, was not in ordinary weather and seasons hidden from the longing
      eyes of the youth of that settlement. That night, however, it was veiled
      in the smoke that encompassed the great highway leading to Excelsior. It
      is presumed that the Burnham brood had long since folded their wings, for
      there was no sign of life nor movement in the house as a rapidly-driven
      horse and buggy pulled up before it. Fortunately, the paternal Burnham was
      an early bird, in the habit of picking up the first stirring mining worm,
      and a resounding knock brought him half dressed to the street door. He was
      startled at seeing Father Wynn before him, a trifle flushed and
      abstracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ha! up betimes, I see, and ready. No sluggards here&mdash;ha, ha!&rdquo; he
      said heartily, slamming the door behind him, and by a series of pokes in
      the ribs genially backing his host into his own sitting-room. &ldquo;I'm up,
      too, and am here to see Nellie. She's here, eh&mdash;of course?&rdquo; he added,
      darting a quick look at Burnham.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Burnham was one of those large, liberal Western husbands who
      classified his household under the general title of &ldquo;woman folk,&rdquo; for the
      integers of which he was not responsible. He hesitated, and then
      propounded over the balusters to the upper story the direct query&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't happen to have Nellie Wynn up there, do ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an interval of inquiry proceeding from half a dozen reluctant
      throats, more or less cottony and muffled, in those various degrees of
      grievance and mental distress which indicate too early roused young
      womanhood. The eventual reply seemed to be affirmative, albeit accompanied
      with a suppressed giggle, as if the young lady had just been discovered as
      an answer to an amusing conundrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Wynn, with an apparent accession of boisterous
      geniality. &ldquo;Tell her I must see her, and I've only got a few minutes to
      spare. Tell her to slip on anything and come down; there's no one here but
      myself, and I've shut the front door on Brother Burnham. Ha, ha!&rdquo; and
      suiting the action to the word, he actually bundled the admiring Brother
      Burnham out on his own doorstep. There was a light pattering on the
      staircase, and Nellie Wynn, pink with sleep, very tall, very slim, hastily
      draped in a white counterpane with a blue border and a general classic
      suggestion, slipped into the parlor. At the same moment her father shut
      the door behind her, placed one hand on the knob, and with the other
      seized her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you yesterday?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nellie looked at him, shrugged her shoulders, and said, &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in the Carquinez Woods with Low Dorman; you went there in
      disguise; you've met him there before. He is your clandestine lover; you
      have taken pledges of affection from him; you have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he tell you this?&rdquo; she asked, with an expression of disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I overheard it. Dunn and Brace were at the house waiting for you.
      When the coach did not bring you, I went to the office to inquire. As I
      left our door I thought I saw somebody listening at the parlor windows. It
      was only a drunken Mexican muleteer leaning against the house; but if HE
      heard nothing, I did. Nellie, I heard Brace tell Dunn that he had tracked
      you in your disguise to the woods&mdash;do you hear? that when you
      pretended to be here with the girls you were with Low&mdash;alone; that
      you wear a ring that Low got of a trader here; that there was a cabin in
      the woods&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wynn again paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did YOU do?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard they were starting down there to surprise you and him together,
      and I harnessed up and got ahead of them in my buggy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And found me here,&rdquo; she said, looking full into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood her and returned the look. He recognized the full importance
      of the culminating fact conveyed in her words, and was obliged to content
      himself with its logical and worldly significance. It was too late now to
      take her to task for mere filial disobedience; they must become allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said hurriedly; &ldquo;but if you value your reputation, if you wish
      to silence both these men, answer me fully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you go to the cabin in the woods yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever go there with Low?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I do not know even where it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wynn felt that she was telling the truth. Nellie knew it; but as she would
      have been equally satisfied with an equally efficacious falsehood, her
      face remained unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when did he leave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At nine o'clock, here. He went to the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He saved his life, then, for Dunn is on his way to the woods to kill
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The jeopardy of her lover did not seem to affect the young girl with
      alarm, although her eyes betrayed some interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Dunn has gone to the woods?&rdquo; she said thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has,&rdquo; replied Wynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know what you are going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I WAS going back to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no time for trifling, girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; she said, with a yawn; &ldquo;it's too early, or too
      late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wynn grasped her wrist more tightly. &ldquo;Hear me! Put whatever face you like
      on this affair, you are compromised&mdash;and compromised with a man you
      can't marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that I ever wanted to marry Low, if you mean him,&rdquo; she said
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dunn wouldn't marry you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so sure of that, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nellie,&rdquo; said Wynn excitedly, &ldquo;do you want to drive me mad? Have you
      nothing to say&mdash;nothing to suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you want me to help you, do you! Why didn't you say that first? Well,
      go and bring Dunn here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad? The man has gone already in pursuit of your lover, believing
      you with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he will the more readily come and talk with me without him. Will you
      take the invitation&mdash;yes or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough. On your way there you will stop at the hotel and give Low a
      letter from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nellie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall read it, of course,&rdquo; she said scornfully, &ldquo;for it will be your
      text for the conversation you will have with him. Will you please take
      your hand from the lock and open the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wynn mechanically opened the door. The young girl flew up-stairs. In a
      very few moments she returned with two notes: one contained a few lines of
      formal invitation to Dunn; the other read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MR. DORMAN,&mdash;My father will tell you how deeply I regret that
      our recent botanical excursions in the Carquinez Woods have been a source
      of serious misapprehensions to those who had a claim to my consideration,
      and that I shall be obliged to discontinue them for the future. At the
      same time he wishes me to express my gratitude for your valuable
      instruction and assistance in that pleasing study, even though approaching
      events may compel me to relinquish it for other duties. May I beg you to
      accept the inclosed ring as a slight recognition of my obligations to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grateful pupil,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NELLIE WYNN.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished reading the letter, she handed him a ring, which he
      took mechanically. He raised his eyes to hers with perfectly genuine
      admiration. &ldquo;You're a good girl, Nellie,&rdquo; he said, and, in a moment of
      parental forgetfulness, unconsciously advanced his lips towards her cheek.
      But she drew back in time to recall him to a sense of that human weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I'll have time for a nap yet,&rdquo; she said, as a gentle hint to
      her embarrassed parent. He nodded and turned towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; she continued, repressing a yawn, &ldquo;I'd manage to be seen
      on good terms with Low at the hotel; so perhaps you need not give the
      letter to him until the last thing. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sitting-room door opened and closed behind her as she slipped
      up-stairs, and her father, without the formality of leave-taking, quietly
      let himself out by the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he drove into the high road again, however, an overlooked possibility
      threatened for a moment to indefinitely postpone his amiable intentions
      regarding Low. The hotel was at the further end of the settlement towards
      the Carquinez Woods, and as Wynn had nearly reached it he was recalled to
      himself by the sounds of hoofs and wheels rapidly approaching from the
      direction of the Excelsior turnpike. Wynn made no doubt it was the sheriff
      and Brace. To avoid recognition at that moment, he whipped up his horse,
      intending to keep the lead until he could turn into the first cross-road.
      But the coming travelers had the fleetest horse, and finding it impossible
      to distance them he drove close to the ditch, pulling up suddenly as the
      strange vehicle was abreast of him, and forcing them to pass him at full
      speed, with the result already chronicled. When they had vanished in the
      darkness, Mr. Wynn, with a heart overflowing with Christian thankfulness
      and universal benevolence, wheeled round, and drove back to the hotel he
      had already passed. To pull up at the veranda with a stentorian shout, to
      thump loudly at the deserted bar, to hilariously beat the panels of the
      landlord's door, and commit a jocose assault and battery upon that
      half-dresssed and half-awakened man, was eminently characteristic of Wynn,
      and part of his amiable plans that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something to wash this wood smoke from my throat, Brother Carter, and
      about as much again to prop open your eyes,&rdquo; he said, dragging Carter
      before the bar, &ldquo;and glasses round for as many of the boys as are up and
      stirring after a hard-working Christian's rest. How goes the honest
      publican's trade, and who have we here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar's Judge Robinson and two lawyers from Sacramento, Dick Curson over
      from Yolo,&rdquo; said Carter, &ldquo;and that ar young Injin yarb doctor from the
      Carquinez Woods. I reckon he's jist up&mdash;I noticed a light under his
      door as I passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's my man for a friendly chat before breakfast,&rdquo; said Wynn. &ldquo;You
      needn't come up. I'll find the way. I don't want a light; I reckon my eyes
      ain't as bright nor as young as his, but they'll see almost as far in the
      dark&mdash;he! he!&rdquo; And, nodding to Brother Carter, he strode along the
      passage, and with no other introduction than a playful and preliminary
      &ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; burst into one of the rooms. Low, who by the light of a single
      candle was bending over the plates of a large quarto, merely raised his
      eyes and looked at the intruder. The young man's natural imperturbability,
      always exasperating to Wynn, seemed accented that morning by contrast with
      his own over-acted animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ha!&mdash;wasting the midnight oil instead of imbibing the morning
      dews,&rdquo; said Father Wynn archly, illustrating his metaphor with a movement
      of his hand to his lips. &ldquo;What have we here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An anonymous gift,&rdquo; replied Low simply, recognizing the father of Nellie
      by rising from his chair. &ldquo;It's a volume I've longed to possess, but never
      could afford to buy. I cannot imagine who sent it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wynn was for a moment startled by the thought that this recipient of
      valuable gifts might have influential friends. But a glance at the bare
      room, which looked like a camp, and the strange, unconventional garb of
      its occupant, restored his former convictions. There might be a promise of
      intelligence, but scarcely of prosperity, in the figure before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! We must not forget that we are watched over in the night season,&rdquo; he
      said, laying his hand on Low's shoulder, with an illustration of celestial
      guardianship that would have been impious but for its palpable
      grotesqueness. &ldquo;No, sir, we know not what a day may bring forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Low's practical mind did not go beyond a mere human
      interpretation. It was enough, however, to put a new light in his eye and
      a faint color in his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could it have been Miss Nellie?&rdquo; he asked, with half-boyish hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wynn was too much of a Christian not to bow before what appeared to
      him the purely providential interposition of this suggestion. Seizing it
      and Low at the same moment, he playfully forced him down again in his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you rascal!&rdquo; he said, with infinite archness; &ldquo;that's your game, is
      it? You want to trap poor Father Wynn. You want to make him say 'No.' You
      want to tempt him to commit himself. No, sir!&mdash;never, sir!&mdash;no,
      no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Firmly convinced that the present was Nellie's, and that her father only
      good-humoredly guessed it, the young man's simple, truthful nature was
      embarrassed. He longed to express his gratitude, but feared to betray the
      young girl's trust. The Reverend Mr. Wynn speedily relieved his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he continued, bestriding a chair, and familiarly confronting Low
      over its back. &ldquo;No, sir&mdash;no! And you want me to say 'No,' don't you,
      regarding the little walks of Nellie and a certain young man in the
      Carquinez Woods?&mdash;ha, ha! You'd like me to say that I knew nothing of
      the botanizings, and the herb collectings, and the picknickings there&mdash;he,
      he!&mdash;you sly dog! Perhaps you'd like to tempt Father Wynn further,
      and make him swear he knows nothing of his daughter disguising herself in
      a duster and meeting another young man&mdash;isn't it another young man?&mdash;all
      alone, eh? Perhaps you want poor old Father Wynn to say No. No, sir,
      nothing of the kind ever occurred. Ah, you young rascal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slightly troubled, in spite of Wynn's hearty manner, Low, with his usual
      directness, however, said, &ldquo;I do not want anyone to deny that I have seen
      Miss Nellie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; said Wynn, abandoning his method, considerably
      disconcerted by Low's simplicity, and a certain natural reserve that shook
      off his familiarity. &ldquo;Certainly it's a noble thing to be able to put your
      hand on your heart and say to the world, 'Come on, all of you! Observe me;
      I have nothing to conceal. I walk with Miss Wynn in the woods as her
      instructor&mdash;her teacher, in fact. We cull a flower here and there; we
      pluck an herb fresh from the hands of the Creator. We look, so to speak,
      from Nature to Nature's God.' Yes, my young friend, we should be the first
      to repel the foul calumny that could misinterpret our most innocent
      actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calumny?&rdquo; repeated Low, starting to his feet. &ldquo;What calumny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend, my noble young friend, I recognize your indignation. I know
      your worth. When I said to Nellie, my only child, my perhaps too simple
      offspring&mdash;a mere wildflower like yourself&mdash;when I said to her,
      'Go, my child, walk in the woods with this young man, hand in hand. Let
      him instruct you from the humblest roots, for he has trodden in the ways
      of the Almighty. Gather wisdom from his lips, and knowledge from his
      simple woodman's craft. Make, in fact, a collection not only of herbs, but
      of moral axioms and experience'&mdash;I knew I could trust you, and,
      trusting you, my young friend, I felt I could trust the world. Perhaps I
      was weak, foolish. But I thought only of her welfare. I even recall how
      that to preserve the purity of her garments, I bade her don a simple
      duster; that, to secure her from the trifling companionship of others, I
      bade her keep her own counsel, and seek you at seasons known but to
      yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But . . . did Nellie . . . understand you?&rdquo; interrupted Low hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you read her simple nature. Understand me? No, not at first! Her
      maidenly instinct&mdash;perhaps her duty to another&mdash;took the alarm.
      I remember her words. 'But what will Dunn say?' she asked. 'Will he not be
      jealous?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunn! jealous! I don't understand,&rdquo; said Low, fixing his eyes on Wynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what I said to Nellie. 'Jealous!' I said. 'What, Dunn, your
      affianced husband, jealous of a mere friend&mdash;a teacher, a guide, a
      philosopher. It is impossible.' Well, sir, she was right. He is jealous.
      And, more than that, he has imparted his jealousy to others! In other
      words, he has made a scandal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low's eyes flashed. &ldquo;Where is your daughter now?&rdquo; he said sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present in bed, suffering from a nervous attack brought on by these
      unjust suspicions. She appreciates your anxiety, and, knowing that you
      could not see her, told me to give you this.&rdquo; He handed Low the ring and
      the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The climax had been forced, and, it must be confessed, was by no means the
      one Mr. Wynn had fully arranged in his own inner consciousness. He had
      intended to take an ostentatious leave of Low in the bar-room, deliver the
      letter with archness, and escape before a possible explosion. He
      consequently backed towards the door for an emergency. But he was again at
      fault. That unaffected stoical fortitude in acute suffering, which was the
      one remaining pride and glory of Low's race, was yet to be revealed to
      Wynn's civilized eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man took the letter, and read it without changing a muscle,
      folded the ring in it, and dropped it into his haversack. Then he picked
      up his blanket, threw it over his shoulder, took his trusty rifle in his
      hand, and turned towards Wynn as if coldly surprised that he was still
      standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you&mdash;going?&rdquo; stammered Wynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you NOT?&rdquo; replied Low dryly, leaning on his rifle for a moment as if
      waiting for Wynn to precede him. The preacher looked at him a moment,
      mumbled something, and then shambled feebly and ineffectively down the
      staircase before Low, with a painful suggestion to the ordinary observer
      of being occasionally urged thereto by the moccasin of the young man
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the lower hall, however, he endeavored to create a diversion
      in his favor by dashing into the bar-room and clapping the occupants on
      the back with indiscriminate playfulness. But here again he seemed to be
      disappointed. To his great discomfiture, a large man not only returned his
      salutation with powerful levity, but with equal playfulness seized him in
      his arms, and after an ingenious simulation of depositing him in the
      horse-trough set him down in affected amazement. &ldquo;Bleth't if I didn't
      think from the weight of your hand it wath my old friend, Thacramento
      Bill,&rdquo; said Curson apologetically, with a wink at the bystanders. &ldquo;That'th
      the way Bill alwayth uthed to tackle hith friendth, till he wath one day
      bounthed by a prithe-fighter in Frithco, whom he had mithtaken for a
      mithionary.&rdquo; As Mr. Curson's reputation was of a quality that made any
      form of apology from him instantly acceptable, the amused spectators made
      way for him as, recognizing Low, who was just leaving the hotel, he turned
      coolly from them and walked towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; he said, extending his hand. &ldquo;You're the man I'm waiting for.
      Did you get a book from the exthpreth offithe latht night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'th all right. Ath I'm rethponthible for it, I only wanted to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did YOU send it?&rdquo; asked Low, quickly fixing his eyes on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not exactly ME. But it'th not worth making a mythtery of it.
      Teretha gave me a commithion to buy it and thend it to you anonymouthly.
      That'th a woman'th nonthenth, for how could thee get a retheipt for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was HER present,&rdquo; said Low gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of courthe. It wathn't mine, my boy. I'd have thent you a Tharp'th rifle
      in plathe of that muthle loader you carry, or thomething thenthible. But,
      I thay! what'th up? You look ath if you had been running all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low grasped his hand. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said hurriedly; &ldquo;but it's nothing.
      Only I must be back to the woods early. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Curson retained Low's hand in his own powerful grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go with you a bit further,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In fact, I've got thomething
      to thay to you; only don't be in thuch a hurry; the woodth can wait till
      you get there.&rdquo; Quietly compelling Low to alter his own characteristic
      Indian stride to keep pace with his, he went on: &ldquo;I don't mind thaying I
      rather cottoned to you from the time you acted like a white man&mdash;no
      offenthe&mdash;to Teretha. She thayth you were left when a child lying
      round, jutht ath promithcuouthly ath she wath; and if I can do anything
      towardth putting you on the trail of your people, I'll do it. I know thome
      of the voyageurth who traded with the Cherokeeth, and your father wath
      one-wathn't he?&rdquo; He glanced at Low's utterly abstracted and immobile face.
      &ldquo;I thay, you don't theem to take a hand in thith game, pardner. What'th
      the row? Ith anything wrong over there?&rdquo; and he pointed to the Carquinez
      Woods, which were just looming out of the morning horizon in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low stopped. The last words of his companion seemed to recall him to
      himself. He raised his eyes automatically to the woods and started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There IS something wrong over there,&rdquo; he said breathlessly. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thee nothing,&rdquo; said Curson, beginning to doubt Low's sanity; &ldquo;nothing
      more than I thaw an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look again. Don't you see that smoke rising straight up? It isn't blown
      over there from the Divide; it's new smoke! The fire is in the woods!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that'th so,&rdquo; muttered Curson, shading his eyes with his hand.
      &ldquo;But, hullo! wait a minute! We'll get hortheth. I say!&rdquo; he shouted,
      forgetting his lisp in his excitement&mdash;&ldquo;stop!&rdquo; But Low had already
      lowered his head and darted forward like an arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments he had left not only his companion but the last
      straggling houses of the outskirts far behind him, and had struck out in a
      long, swinging trot for the disused &ldquo;cut-off.&rdquo; Already he fancied he heard
      the note of clamor in Indian Spring, and thought he distinguished the
      sound of hurrying hoofs on the great highway. But the sunken trail hid it
      from his view. From the column of smoke now plainly visible in the growing
      morning light he tried to locate the scene of the conflagration. It was
      evidently not a fire advancing regularly from the outer skirt of the wood,
      communicated to it from the Divide; it was a local outburst near its
      centre. It was not in the direction of his cabin in the tree. There was no
      immediate danger to Teresa, unless fear drove her beyond the confines of
      the wood into the hands of those who might recognize her. The screaming of
      jays and ravens above his head quickened his speed, as it heralded the
      rapid advance of the flames; and the unexpected apparition of a bounding
      body, flattened and flying over the yellow plain, told him that even the
      secure retreat of the mountain wild-cat had been invaded. A sudden
      recollection of Teresa's uncontrollable terror that first night smote him
      with remorse and redoubled his efforts. Alone in the track of these
      frantic and bewildered beasts, to what madness might she not be driven!
    </p>
    <p>
      The sharp crack of a rifle from the high road turned his course
      momentarily in that direction. The smoke was curling lazily over the heads
      of the party of men in the road, while the huge hulk of a grizzly was
      disappearing in the distance. A battue of the escaping animals had
      commenced! In the bitterness of his heart he caught at the horrible
      suggestion, and resolved to save her from them or die with her there.

      How fast he ran, or the time it took him to reach the woods, has never
      been known. Their outlines were already hidden when he entered them. To a
      sense less keen, a courage less desperate, and a purpose less unaltered
      than Low's, the wood would have been impenetrable. The central fire was
      still confined to the lofty tree tops, but the downward rush of wind from
      time to time drove the smoke into the aisles in blinding and suffocating
      volumes. To simulate the creeping animals, and fall to the ground on hands
      and knees, feel his way through the underbrush when the smoke was densest,
      or take advantage of its momentary lifting, and without uncertainty,
      mistake, or hesitation glide from tree to tree in one undeviating course,
      was possible only to an experienced woodsman. To keep his reason and
      insight so clear as to be able in the midst of this bewildering confusion
      to shape that course so as to intersect the wild and unknown tract of an
      inexperienced, frightened wanderer belonged to Low, and Low alone. He was
      making his way against the wind towards the fire. He had reasoned that she
      was either in comparative safety to windward of it, or he should meet her
      being driven towards him by it, or find her succumbed and fainting at its
      feet. To do this he must penetrate the burning belt, and then pass under
      the blazing dome. He was already upon it; he could see the falling fire
      dropping like rain or blown like gorgeous blossoms of the conflagration
      across his path. The space was lit up brilliantly. The vast shafts of dull
      copper cast no shadow below, but there was no sign nor token of any human
      being. For a moment the young man was at fault. It was true this hidden
      heart of the forest bore no undergrowth; the cool matted carpet of the
      aisles seemed to quench the glowing fragments as they fell. Escape might
      be difficult, but not impossible, yet every moment was precious. He leaned
      against a tree, and sent his voice like a clarion before him: &ldquo;Teresa!&rdquo;
       There was no reply. He called again. A faint cry at his back from the
      trail he had just traversed made him turn. Only a few paces behind him,
      blinded and staggering, but following like a beaten and wounded animal,
      Teresa, halted, knelt, clasped her hands, and dumbly held them out before
      her. &ldquo;Teresa!&rdquo; he cried again, and sprang to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught him by the knees, and lifted her face imploringly to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that again!&rdquo; she cried, passionately. &ldquo;Tell me it was Teresa you
      called, and no other! You have come back for me! You would not let me die
      here alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her tenderly in his arms, and cast a rapid glance around him. It
      might have been his fancy, but there seemed a dull glow in the direction
      he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not speak!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tell me! You did not come here to seek
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom?&rdquo; he said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nellie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sharp cry he let her slip to the ground. All the pent-up agony,
      rage, and mortification of the last hour broke from him in that
      inarticulate outburst. Then, catching her hands again, he dragged her to
      his level.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me!&rdquo; he cried, disregarding the whirling smoke and the fiery baptism
      that sprinkled them&mdash;&ldquo;hear me! If you value your life, if you value
      your soul, and if you do not want me to cast you to the beasts like
      Jezebel of old, never&mdash;never take that accursed name again upon your
      lips. Seek her&mdash;HER? Yes! Seek her to tie her like a witch's daughter
      of hell to that blazing tree!&rdquo; He stopped. &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said in a
      changed voice. &ldquo;I'm mad, and forgetting myself and you. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without noticing the expression of half-savage delight that had passed
      across her face, he lifted her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way are you going?&rdquo; she asked, passing her hands vaguely across his
      breast, as if to reassure herself of his identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To our camp by the scarred tree,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not there, not there,&rdquo; she said, hurriedly. &ldquo;I was driven from there just
      now. I thought the fire began there until I came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it was as he feared. Obeying the same mysterious law that had
      launched this fatal fire like a thunderbolt from the burning mountain
      crest five miles away into the heart of the Carquinez Woods, it had again
      leaped a mile beyond, and was hemming them between two narrowing lines of
      fire. But Low was not daunted. Retracing his steps through the blinding
      smoke, he strode off at right angles to the trail near the point where he
      had entered the wood. It was the spot where he had first lifted Nellie in
      his arms to carry her to the hidden spring. If any recollection of it
      crossed his mind at that moment, it was only shown in his redoubled
      energy. He did not glide through the thick underbrush, as on that day, but
      seemed to take a savage pleasure in breaking through it with sheer brute
      force. Once Teresa insisted upon relieving him of the burden of her
      weight, but after a few steps she staggered blindly against him, and would
      fain have recourse once more to his strong arms. And so, alternately
      staggering, bending, crouching, or bounding and crashing on, but always in
      one direction, they burst through the jealous rampart, and came upon the
      sylvan haunt of the hidden spring. The great angle of the half-fallen tree
      acted as a harrier to the wind and drifting smoke, and the cool spring
      sparkled and bubbled in the almost translucent air. He laid her down
      beside the water, and bathed her face and hands. As he did so his quick
      eye caught sight of a woman's handkerchief lying at the foot of the
      disrupted root. Dropping Teresa's hand, he walked towards it, and with the
      toe of his moccasin gave it one vigorous kick into the ooze at the
      overflow of the spring. He turned to Teresa, but she evidently had not
      noticed the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; she asked, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in her movement struck him! He came towards her, and bending
      down looked into her face. &ldquo;Teresa! Good God!&mdash;look at me! What has
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes to his. There was a slight film across them; the lids
      were blackened; the beautiful lashes gone forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you a little now, I think,&rdquo; she said, with a smile, passing her
      hands vaguely over his face. &ldquo;It must have happened when he fainted, and I
      had to drag him through the blazing brush; both my hands were full, and I
      could not cover my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drag whom?&rdquo; said Low, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dunn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunn! He here?&rdquo; said Low, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; didn't you read the note I left on the herbarium? Didn't you come to
      the camp-fire?&rdquo; she asked hurriedly, clasping his hands. &ldquo;Tell me
      quickly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were not there&mdash;then you didn't leave me to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I swear it, Teresa!&rdquo; the stoicism that had upheld his own agony
      breaking down before her strong emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; She threw her arms around him, and hid her aching eyes in his
      troubled breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all, Teresa,&rdquo; he whispered in her listening ear. &ldquo;Don't move;
      stay there, and tell me all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her face buried in his bosom, as if speaking to his heart alone, she
      told him part, but not all. With her eyes filled with tears, but a smile
      on her lips, radiant with new-found happiness, she told him how she had
      overheard the plans of Dunn and Brace, how she had stolen their conveyance
      to warn him in time. But here she stopped, dreading to say a word that
      would shatter the hope she was building upon his sudden revulsion of
      feeling for Nellie. She could not bring herself to repeat their interview&mdash;that
      would come later, when they were safe and out of danger; now not even the
      secret of his birth must come between them with its distraction, to mar
      their perfect communion. She faltered that Dunn had fainted from weakness,
      and that she had dragged him out of danger. &ldquo;He will never interfere with
      us&mdash;I mean,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;with ME again. I can promise you that
      as well as if he had sworn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him pass, now,&rdquo; said Low; &ldquo;that will come later on,&rdquo; he added,
      unconsciously repeating her thought in a tone that made her heart sick.
      &ldquo;But tell me, Teresa, why did you go to Excelsior?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She buried her head still deeper, as if to hide it. He felt her broken
      heart beat against his own; he was conscious of a depth of feeling her
      rival had never awakened in him. The possibility of Teresa loving him had
      never occurred to his simple nature. He bent his head and kissed her. She
      was frightened, and unloosed her clinging arms; but he retained her hand,
      and said, &ldquo;We will leave this accursed place, and you shall go with me as
      you said you would; nor need you ever leave me, unless you wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could hear the beating of her own heart through his words; she longed
      to look at the eyes and lips that told her this, and read the meaning his
      voice alone could not entirely convey. For the first time she felt the
      loss of her sight. She did not know that it was, in this moment of
      happiness, the last blessing vouchsafed to her miserable life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments of silence followed, broken only by the distant rumor of the
      conflagration and the crash of falling boughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be an hour yet,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;before the fire has swept a path
      for us to the road below. We are safe here, unless some sudden current
      should draw the fire down upon us. You are not frightened?&rdquo; She pressed
      his hand; she was thinking of the pale face of Dunn, lying in the secure
      retreat she had purchased for him at such a sacrifice. Yet the possibility
      of danger to him now for a moment marred her present happiness and
      security. &ldquo;You think the fire will not go north of where you found me?&rdquo;
       she asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I will reconnoitre. Stay where you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They pressed hands, and parted. He leaped upon the slanting trunk and
      ascended it rapidly. She waited in mute expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden movement of the root on which she sat, a deafening
      crash, and she was thrown forward on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast bulk of the leaning tree, dislodged from its aerial support by
      the gradual sapping of the spring at its roots, or by the crumbling of the
      bark from the heat, had slipped, made a half revolution, and, falling,
      overbore the lesser trees in its path, and tore, in its resistless
      momentum, a broad opening to the underbrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cry to Low, Teresa staggered to her feet. There was an interval of
      hideous silence, but no reply. She called again. There was a sudden
      deepening roar, the blast of a fiery furnace swept through the opening, a
      thousand luminous points around her burst into fire, and in an instant she
      was lost in a whirlwind of smoke and flame! From the onset of its fury to
      its culmination twenty minutes did not elapse; but in that interval a
      radius of two hundred yards around the hidden spring was swept of life and
      light and motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of that day and part of the night a pall of smoke hung above
      the scene of desolation. It lifted only towards the morning, when the
      moon, rising high, picked out in black and silver the shrunken and silent
      columns of those roofless vaults, shorn of base and capital. It flickered
      on the still, overflowing pool of the hidden spring, and shone upon the
      white face of Low, who, with a rootlet of the fallen tree holding him down
      like an arm across his breast, seemed to be sleeping peacefully in the
      sleeping water.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Contemporaneous history touched him as briefly, but not as gently. &ldquo;It is
      now definitely ascertained,&rdquo; said &ldquo;The Slumgullion Mirror,&rdquo; &ldquo;that Sheriff
      Dunn met his fate in the Carquinez Woods in the performance of his duty;
      that fearless man having received information of the concealment of a band
      of horse thieves in their recesses. The desperadoes are presumed to have
      escaped, as the only remains found are those of two wretched tramps, one
      of whom is said to have been a digger, who supported himself upon roots
      and herbs, and the other a degraded half-white woman. It is not
      unreasonable to suppose that the fire originated through their
      carelessness, although Father Wynn of the First Baptist Church, in his
      powerful discourse of last Sunday, pointed at the warning and lesson of
      such catastrophes. It may not be out of place here to say that the rumors
      regarding an engagement between the pastor's accomplished daughter and the
      late lamented sheriff are utterly without foundation, as it has been an on
      dit for some time in all well-informed circles that the indefatigable Mr.
      Brace, of Wells, Fargo and Co.'s Express, will shortly lead the lady to
      the hymeneal altar.&rdquo;
     </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
